PREFACE


The principal purpose of this book is to give in brief form the rules and
usages governing the division of words when the measure will not permit
ending the word and the line together. This matter is considered in its
relation to good spacing and to the legibility of the printed page.

Leading up to the discussion will be found some consideration of spelling,
the formation of syllables, pronunciation, and accent. This consideration
is necessarily brief, and no attempt has been made to give the rules for
spelling which are so frequently found in spelling books, or any of them.
In the writer's opinion such rules are of very little practical value. Good
spelling is not so much the result of remembering and applying rules as it
is of observation, practice, and memory. The lists of certain types of
troublesome words may be found useful for ready reference.

Syllable formation, pronunciation, and accent are considered because it is
hoped that the volumes of this series, particularly those in Part VI
(Correct Literary Composition) and Part VIII (History of Printing), will
contribute something to the general education of the apprentice as well as
to his skill in the trade.

DIVISION OF WORDS


The division of words when the words do not exactly fit the register of the
line has always been a source of trouble. In the days of the manuscript
makers devices such as crowding letters, reducing their size, or omitting
them altogether were freely used and words were arbitrarily divided when
the scribes so desired. During the greater part of the time every scribe
divided as he pleased, often in ways which seem very strange to us, like
the Greek custom of dividing always after a vowel and even dividing words
of one syllable. With the invention of printing, however, the number of
these devices was greatly diminished. It became a matter of spacing out the
line or dividing the word. Of course that meant frequent word division and
called for a systematization of rules with regard to this division. These
rules for division are necessarily based on spelling and syllabication.




SPELLING


The idea that there is one right way to combine the letters representing a
certain sound or group of sounds, that is a word, and that all other ways
are wrong and little short of shameful is a comparatively new idea among
us. The English speaking folk held down to a comparatively recent time that
any group of letters which approximately represented the sound was amply
sufficient as a symbol of the word. This sort of phonetic spelling was
commonly followed, and followed with great freedom. No obligation was
recognized to be consistent. In ordinary writing, such as letters and the
like, it is not unusual to find the same word spelled in a variety of ways
in the same document.

The last century has brought about an attempt to standardize spelling into
conventional forms any departure from which is regarded as highly
derogatory to the writer. In many cases these forms are fixed arbitrarily,
and in some there is even now disagreement among the highest authorities.
These difficulties and disagreements have two reasons: First, English is a
composite language, drawn from many sources and at many periods; hence
purely philological and etymological influences intervene, sometimes with
marked results, while there is a difference of opinion as to how far these
influences ought to prevail. Second, the English language uses an alphabet
which fits it very badly. Many letters have to do duty for the expression
of several sounds, and sometimes several of them have nearly or quite the
same sound. For example, there are a number of distinct sounds of _a_, _i_,
and _o_ while _g_ is sometimes indistinguishable from _j_ and _c_ from _k_.
This is not always a matter of modification of sounds by the sounds of
other letters combined with them. One has to learn how to pronounce
_cough_, _dough_, _enough_, and _plough_, the _ough_ having four distinct
sounds in these four words. Each one of these sounds, by the way, could be
exactly as well represented by another combination of letters which would
be unmistakable, viz., _coff_, _doe_, _enuff_, and _plow_. It is impossible
to tell except by the context either the pronunciation or the meaning of
_bow_. If the _ow_ is pronounced as in _low_, it means a weapon. If the
_ow_ is pronounced as in _cow_ it may mean either an obeisance or the front
end of a boat.

This standardization of spelling is unfortunately not quite complete,
although nearly so. Concerning the vast majority of the words in the
English language there is no difference of opinion. A few words are
differently spelled by different authorities. There are seven of these
authorities of the first rank, three English, Stormonth, the Imperial
Dictionary, and the Oxford Dictionary; and four American, Webster's
International, Worcester, the Century Dictionary, and the Standard
Dictionary. American printers may ordinarily disregard the English
authorities.

Any one of the four American authorities may be safely followed. In cases
where two spellings are given in the dictionary consulted, take the first
one. Ordinarily a printing office adopts one of the great authorities as a
standard and conforms the office style to it. All office copy will follow
it and all errors in copy from outside will be corrected by it. Spellings
differing from it will be regarded as errors, even though supported by
other authorities.

This rule, however, is subject to one very important exception. The author
has an unquestionable right to choose his own dictionary or to use any
spelling for which there is any authority, English or American. If he has
his own ideas on the subject of spelling he should be very careful that his
manuscript is correctly spelled according to his ideas, and clearly written
or typed. He should also indicate on the manuscript the authority he wishes
used in correcting the spelling in case of mistakes or illegible passages.
Every care should be taken to make the manuscript copy as correct as
possible and as legible as possible. Such care may be very troublesome at
first, but it will result in great saving of expense.

In addition to the authorities named there are the rules and "reformed"
spellings adopted by the American Philological Association and published by
the United States Government. These are followed fully in some offices,
partly in others, and in many not at all. This is a question of the office
style and the author's wish. If copy is clear and spelled according to any
authority, it is the compositor's duty to follow it. If it is misspelled or
illegible he is to correct it according to the office style unless
otherwise directed by the author in writing. If furnished with such a
direction he is to follow it. This procedure will clear the compositor of
all blame. Any questions which then arise lie between the author and the
proofreader.

In the case of the reformed spellings, however, the departure from the
ordinary appearance of the words is so great that the author cannot be
allowed full freedom to set aside the office style. If he is paying for the
printing he may insist on his spelling. If he is contributing to a
periodical and the printing is done at the publisher's expense it is for
the publisher to determine the style of printing to be used.

Any full consideration of the question of reformed spelling is hardly in
place in this book. The author may perhaps be permitted one observation.
Innovation in the use of the English language would appear to be primarily
the work of scholars, and the adoption of such innovations would seem to
belong to the book printer rather than to the commercial printer. The
public mind as a whole is conservative. It is not hospitable to changes and
does not soon become aware of them, much less familiar with them. The
commercial printer makes his appeal to the mind of the general public. He
will do well to use a vehicle familiar, intelligible, and acceptable to it.

Correct spelling is mainly a matter of habit and observation. To a certain
extent it is a matter of careful pronunciation, but this is not always a
safe or even a possible guide. The vowels preceding or following the one on
which the primary accent falls, sometimes called obscure vowels, are so
slurringly pronounced that even a pedantic precision will hardly make it
possible to indicate clearly which vowel is used. The writer remembers
seeing an examination paper written by a fourth year medical student in
which the word _fever_ was spelled _fevor_. A moment's thought will show
that so far as pronunciation is concerned the word might be spelled
_fevar_, _fevir_, _fevor_, _fever_, or _fevur_ without any appreciable
difference. The correct spelling is merely a matter of observation.

The author has on his desk at the moment of writing these lines half a
dozen good books, each containing a set of rules for spelling. From these
it would be easy to compile a set of fairly good rules. Each of these
rules, however, has exceptions, in some cases quite numerous. To remember
these rules with their exceptions would be a considerable mental task and
to apply them would be cumbrous and time consuming. The effort would
probably resolve itself into an actual learning of the words which present
difficulties. The best way to become a good speller is to form the habit
of careful reading, observing the form of every word as it passes before
the eye and so unconsciously fixing it in the memory. The dictionary should
be consulted whenever there is any doubt.

If you are to write a word, call up a mental picture of it, and if the
picture is not perfectly clear go to the dictionary and fix a correct image
of it in your mind. Be careful to pronounce every word you use as correctly
as possible and you will get all the aid pronunciation can give you.
Careless speaking and careless reading are the two great sources of
incorrect spelling.

The following tables will be found useful in settling practice with regard
to certain troublesome classes of words.

The instructor should drill the pupils in spelling not only these "catch"
words, but a wide range of English words. These lessons may be taken to
advantage from some of the books mentioned in the list for supplementary
reading, from any other good spelling book, or even from the pages of any
well printed book or magazine. The words should be given out orally and
written down by the pupil. A good exercise is the reading of a paragraph
from any good book, or some stanza of poetry, the passage read to be taken
down by the pupil with care to spell, punctuate, and capitalize properly.

A number of topics sometimes treated under the head of spelling will be
found discussed in the "Printer's Manual of Style" (No. 41).




PRONUNCIATION


The English language is a difficult one to pronounce as well as to spell.
This arises from two causes. The English language has some sounds not
generally found in other languages, such as _w_ and _th_. As has already
been pointed out, the alphabet fits the language very badly. Careful
lexicographers indicate no less than seven sounds of _a_, five of _e_,
three of _i_, four of _o_ and six of _u_, as shown in the following table:

[=a] as in [=a]le
[Ia] as in sen[Ia]te
[)a] as in [)a]m
á as in ásk
[a:] as in [a:]ll
ä as in fäther
(a) as in fin(a)l

[=e] as in [=e]ve
[)e] as in [)e]nd
[Ie] as in ev[Ie]nt
[~e] as in f[~e]rn
(e) as in prud(e)nce

[=i] as in [=i]ce
[Ii] as in [Ii]dea
[)i] as in p[)i]n

[=o] as in [=o]ld
[Io] as in [Io]pen
[)o] as in [)o]dd
ô as in ôrb

[=u] as in [=u]se
[Iu] as in [Iu]nite
[)u] as in [)u]p
[u:] as in r[u:]de
[u=] as in f[u=]ll
û as in ûrn

In addition to these there are diphthongs, combinations of vowel sounds
pronounced as one syllable, such as

_ou_ as in _out_
_oi_ as in _oil_

There are also a number of digraphs or combinations of vowels or consonants
which have but one sound, such as

_ai_ as in _rain_
_eo_ as in _people_
_ou_ as in _soup_
_ou_ as in _soul_
_ph_ as in _phalanx_
_ch_ as in _chorus_ or _chair_

_C_ has two sounds, hard before _a_, _o_, and _u_, as in _cat_, _cot_, and
_cut_, and soft before _e_, _i_, and _y_, as in _cell_, _city_, and
_cycle_.

_G_ has two sounds, hard before _a_, _o_, and _u_, as in _gate_, _gone_,
and _gun_, soft before _e_, _i_, and _y_, as in _gem_, _gin_, and _gyve_,
although it is sometimes hard before _i_ as in _girl_.

_Ch_ is sometimes soft as in _chair_ and _arch_, and sometimes hard as in
_choir_.

_Th_ has two sounds, soft, or surd, as in _thin_ and _death_, and hard, or
sonant, as in _then_ and _smooth_.

_S_ has two sounds, soft, or surd, as in _soft_ and _this_, and hard, or
sonant, as in _has_ and _wise_.

We have, therefore, twenty-six letters with which to express fifty or more
sounds, not counting the digraphs and diphthongs.

Correct pronunciation depends upon three things, correct sounding of the
letters, correct division into syllables, and correct placing of the
accent.

A syllable is the smallest separately articulated, or pronounced, element
in speech, or one of the parts into which speech is broken. It consists of
a vowel alone or accompanied by one or more consonants and separated by
them, or by a pause, from a preceding or following vowel. This division of
words into syllables is indicated in dictionaries by the use of the hyphen
thus: _sub-trac-tion_, _co-or-din-ate_. It will be observed that in the
first of these examples the vowels are all separated by consonants, while
in the second two of them are separated by a pause only.

The English language has the further peculiarity of using _l_ and _n_ as
vowels in syllabication, as in _middle_ (_mid-dl_) and _reck-on_
(_reck-n_).

The division of words into syllables for pronunciation is generally, but
not always, the same as that which should be followed in case the word has
to be divided typographically. As these text-books are intended to help the
apprentice as a speaker and writer of English as well as a printer, it is
worth while to give some attention to syllabication for pronunciation
before proceeding to discuss typographical division.[The illustrations from
this point to the end of this section on page 16 are not typographic
divisions. They concern pronunciation only.]

Two letters forming a diphthong or digraph are not to be separated.
_Coin-age_ (_oi_ diphthong) but _co-in-ci-dence_ (_oi_ not a diphthong).
_Excess_ (_ss_ digraph, pronounced practically like a single s) gives
_ex-cess-es_, _ex-cess-ive_, etc. Whether or not the letters thus occurring
together form a diphthong or digraph will depend on the derivation of the
word, thus in _cat-head_ (verb), a nautical term, _th_ is not a digraph but
in _ca-the-dral_ _th_ is a digraph, as is usually the case with these two
letters. You would not say _cat-hed-ral_.

Two vowels, or a vowel and a diphthong, coming together but sounded
separately belong to separate syllables.

_A-or-ta_, _co-op-er-ate_, but _coop-er-age_, _moi-e-ty_.

Do not end a syllable with

     (_a_) _c_ or _g_ when soft, _en-ti-cing_, but _dic-tion_, _wa-ges_
     but _wag-on_.

     (_b_) _t_, _s_, _z_, _c_, _sc_, _g_, and _d_, when followed by _i_
     or _e_ giving the sound of _sh_; _ra-tion-al_, _o-cean_, _re-gion_,
     _as-cen-sion_.

     (_c_) _d_, _s_, _t_, and _z_ when followed by _u_ giving the sound
     of _ch_, _sh_, _zh_, or _j_, _cen-sure_, _sei-zure_, _na-ture_,
     _ver-dure_.

Do not begin a syllable with

     (_a_) _x_ with the sound of _ks_ or _gs_, _anx-ious_, _ex-act-ly_.

     (_b_) _r_ preceded by _a_ or _e_; _par-ent_, _av-er-age_, but by
     exception, _pa-rent-al_.

     (_c_) Single _l_, _n_, or _v_, followed by _i_ with the sound of
     _y_ consonant; _fol-io_ (_fol-yo_), _gen-ius_ (_gen-yus_),
     _sav-ior_ (_sav-yor_).

Prefixes and suffixes are generally separated, _yel-low-ish_, _eat-able_,
_pre-lude_. This last word is sometimes pronounced _prel-ude_ and this
pronunciation has some dictionary support, but it is objectionable.

A consonant or digraph between two sounded vowels usually joins the
following vowel, _rea-son_, _no-ti-fy_, _mo-ther_.

When two or three consonants capable of beginning a syllable come between
two sounded vowels they may all be joined to the following vowel.

     (_a_) When the preceding vowel is long and accented; _en-a-bling_,
     _He-brew_, _i-dler_.

     (_b_) When the following vowel is an accented syllable; _o-blige_,
     _re-dress_.

When two or three consonants capable of beginning a syllable come between
two sounded vowels one may be joined to the preceding vowel.

     (_a_) When the vowel is short; _tab-let_, _res-cue_, _mus-ket_.

     (_b_) When the consonants are _st_, _str_, or _sp_, if either the
     preceding or following vowel is accented; _mis-tress_, _aus-tere_,
     _oys-ter_, _sus-pect_.

When a consonant is doubled (not forming a digraph) the two are generally
separated; _beg-gar_, _bril-liant_, _cun-ning_.

The old-fashioned method of oral spelling by syllables
_m-a-s-mas-t-e-r-ter-master_ will be found extremely useful in teaching
correct syllabication. It is recommended that constant use be made of it in
spelling drill.




ACCENT


When a word consists of two syllables one of them receives more stress of
voice than the other. This stress of voice is called accent. If the word
consists of three or more syllables there is usually another syllable
stressed in somewhat less degree. This is called a secondary accent. In
some cases there may even be a third accent if the word is very long;
_In'-come_, _val-e-tu'-di-na'-ri-an_. This fact arises from the tendency
natural to all human speech to take more or less musical forms. The
monotony of a series of stressed or of unstressed sounds would be
unbearable. The pronunciation of such a series would be a highly artificial
and very difficult performance. Correct pronunciation is very greatly
concerned with the proper placing of the accent. Indeed the meaning of a
familiar word may be quite obscured by a misplaced accent. For example,
_he-red'-it-ary_ is a very familiar word, but when pronounced
_he-red-it'-ary_, as it was habitually by a friend of the author, we have
to stop and think before catching the meaning.

The placing of the accent in English is subject to two general rules.

     I  The accent clings to the syllable which gives the meaning to the
     word, or in technical terms, the root syllable, _re-call'_,
     _in-stall'_, _in-stal-la'-tion_ (accent falling on the syllable
     which defines the word as a noun), _in-her'-it_.

     II  Where the root syllable is not known the accent falls on the
     first syllable, with secondary accents following at intervals to
     relieve the voice.

This last tendency not infrequently supersedes the other, partly from the
natural habit of the language, and partly because the average man is not an
etymologist and knows very little about the derivation of the words he
uses. For example, in Shakespeare's time English people followed the first
rule and said _re-ven'-ue_, but now we say _rev'-e-nue_.

These two rules will serve as a good general guide to accent. Attention
should be paid to the pronunciation of good speakers, and care taken to
follow it. In case of doubt the dictionary should be consulted and the
proper accent carefully fixed in the mind.




DIVISION OF WORDS


When the words do not fit the line what shall we do? The early printers
used only one kind of spaces. In setting a line of type they proceeded
until there was no room in the line for the next complete word of the copy.
Then they filled out the line with spaces and began the next word on the
next line. The length of the register being known in advance and nothing
but spaces being used in setting the line, the compositor was spared much
that makes composition at once a hard labor and a fine art. The result was
an irregular margin at the right such as we now see in typewritten letters.

With improvements in types and typography the squaring out of the page soon
came into fashion. In many cases this can be done by the careful use of
spaces so as to bring a certain number of words squarely out to the end of
the line. There have been printers who have insisted that this should
always be done. Their efforts have not, however, been successful. They
result in a freakish looking page with white spots in the lines where
letters or words have been spaced out to fill the register. It would be
better, on the whole, to resort to the practice of the old masters and
leave the right-hand margin irregular.

Ordinarily the difficulty has been met by dividing words and putting a part
of a word on one line and the rest of it on another, indicating the break
by a hyphen. The hyphen in such a case is always the closing character in
the first line. Clearly this division must be so made as to assist the
reader in his task. The primary purpose of all printing is to be read.
Anything that adds to the legibility of the printing improves it; anything
that detracts from its legibility harms it. How can we so divide words that
the legibility and intelligibility of the text will be maintained, the line
justified to register, and the beauty of the page enhanced? These
ends--legibility, intelligibility, and beauty--are the aims of all the
rules which have been devised for the division of words. These are the
things the reader will see and by them he will judge the results. He will
probably know nothing about the rules by which the compositor gains his
results. The compositor needs to know the rules, but to remember always
that they are only means by which to secure results.

There have been several attempts to devise systems of division, but no one
of them is thoroughly consistent or universally adopted.

One system requires the division of a word when the pronunciation will
permit on the vowel at the end of the syllable. It has the defect of making
no provision for syllables that end in consonants. Moreover, if rigorously
applied it would give us such divisions as _ca-pa-ci-ty_, _cata-stro-phe_,
_lexi-co-gra-pher_, _pre-fe-rence_, _pro-gno-sti-cate_, and _re-co-gnize_.

Another system requires the division of consolidated words at the junction
of their elements, for example:

_magn-animous_
_cata-clysm_
_found-ation_
_oceano-graphy_
_theo-logy_
_know-ledge_
_lexi-co-grapher_
_in-fer-ence_
_pre-judice_
_pro-gnos-ticate_
_pro-position_
_typo-graphy_

In some cases this rule would lead to queer looking divisions. More serious
objections are that the system does not provide for words that are long
enough to be divided but are yet not consolidated words, and, most of all,
that the average compositor is not an accomplished etymologist and knows
very little about the derivation, make up, and compounding of the words he
has to set up. He may be familiar, for example with the word _rheostat_,
but it would puzzle him to tell from what language it is derived, while the
word _enclave_ would probably send him to the dictionary for meaning as
well as derivation, unless he happened to be used to one particular kind of
writing.

Another system, and probably on the whole the best one, requires the
division of the word on the accented syllable.

_theol-ogy_
_catas-trophe_
_geog-raphy_
_lexi-cog-rapher_
_pref-erence_
_prog-nos-ticate_

It will be noted that some of these examples show division in more than one
place, that is on the syllables which bear either the primary or the
secondary accent. This rule does not provide for the cases when the
division must come on an unaccented syllable. The cases, however, when the
division cannot be made to come on either the syllable bearing the primary
accent or one bearing a secondary accent will be comparatively few.




RULES FOR DIVISION OF WORDS


I The general rule, then, is to divide according to pronunciation, not
according to etymology or any hard and fast rule.

     As far as possible, consistently with pronunciation and good
     spacing, divide according to meaning and derivation, where known.

     _un-even_, not _une-ven_, _auto-mobile_, not _automo-bile_,
     _en-abled_, not _ena-bled_.

II Divide on a vowel wherever practicable. In case a vowel alone forms a
syllable in the middle of a word it should be run into the first line.

_busi-ness_
_sepa-rate_
_criti-cism_
_particu-lar_
_colo-nies_
_dou-ble_
_pro-gress_
_pro-duct_
_noi-sy_
_wo-man_
_pa-tron_
_me-moir_

III When two consonants meet between vowels, and the syllable ends on one
consonant, the division may properly be made between the consonants, the
pronunciation determining the place of division.

_advan-tage_
_plain-tiff_
_Wil-liam_
_exces-sive_
_scur-rilous_
_mas-ter_
_gram-mar_
_profes-sor_
_moun-tain_

IV When three consonants come together between two vowels the first of
which is short, the division comes after the first consonant.

_han-dle_
_chil-dren_
_frus-trate_

V A single consonant between two vowels should be joined to the first
vowel, if it is short; if the first vowel is long the consonant goes with
the second.

_riv-er_
_ri-val_

VI Diphthongs should not be divided.

_peo-ple_
_Cae-sar_

VII Words compounded with a prefix should preferably be divided on the
prefix.

_dis-avow_
_in-herit_
_un-concern_

VIII The terminations _-able_, _-ible_, _-tion_, _-cial_, _-tive_, and
_-ive_ should go over to the next line.

_read-able_
_convert-ible_
_inten-tion_
_discuss-ion_

     The termination _-sion_ ordinarily goes over as in

_occa-sion_
_apprehen-sion_
_cis-sion_
_declen-sion_

     Occasionally, however, the strong emphasis needed for the _s_ will
     call for a different arrangement, as in _divis-ion_.

IX The terminations _-ing_, _-en_, _-ed_, _-er_, _-est_, and the plural
_-es_ go over to the next line except when the preceding consonant is
doubled, or when they follow _c_ or _g_ soft.

_lead-ing_
_beat-en_
_larg-er_, but
_lat-ter_
_for-cing_
_ran-ging_

X Do not end a line with _j_ or with _c_ or _g_ soft.

_pro-cess_
_ne-cessary_
_pre-judice_
_prog-eny_

XI Adjectives in _ical_ divide on the _i_.

_physi-cal_
_inimi-cal_

XII In derivatives of words ending in _-t_, the division follows the
accent.

_objec-tion_, not _object-ion_, _defec-tion_, not _defect-ion_, but
_respec-tively_, not _respect-ively_ and _distinc-tion_, not
_distinct-ion_.

XIII Never separate _c_ and _g_ from the vowels _e_, _i_, and _y_ upon
which their soft sound depends.

_re-li-gion_
_ca-pa-ci-ty_

XIV Never separate _q_ from _u_, _qu_ is a single sound.

XV Do not divide _nothing_.

XVI Do not divide words of four letters.

XVII Do not divide words of five or six letters if it can be avoided. Good
spacing, however, must be considered of first importance.

XVIII In wide measures (20 ems or more) do not divide so as to end or begin
a line with a syllable of two letters. Here again, however, good spacing is
the first consideration.

XIX Do not divide words of two syllables pronounced as one, including past
participles of short words.

_heaven_
_power_
_prayer_
_beamed_
_often_

XX Avoid additional hyphens in hyphenated words if possible.

_object-lesson_
_fellow-being_
_poverty-stricken_

XXI Do not separate a divisional mark (_a_), (_1_) from the matter to which
it pertains.

XXII Do not divide an amount stated in figures.

XXIII Do not divide proper names, especially those of persons, if it can be
avoided.

XXIV Do not divide initials or such combinations as _a.m._, _B.C._

XXV Do not divide the last word on a page so as to carry a part of it to
the next page.

XXVI Do not divide the last word of the last full line of a paragraph.

XXVII More than two divisions in successive lines should be avoided.

XXVIII Never divide at all if you can help it.




IMPORTANCE OF SPACING


It must always be remembered that good spacing is the first consideration.
Nothing is more offensive to the eye of a good judge of printing than bad
spacing. "Rivers" of white, dark spots, crowded black text, are very
serious blemishes to a page. An ordinary book page is a study in color, the
colors employed being black and white. Proper combination, balance, and
proportion are as important here as in places where a variety of colors is
employed. Many of the foregoing rules must be held subject to the
exigencies of proper spacing. A rigid adherence, for example, to the rule
that not more than two consecutive lines should end with divided words will
not justify a badly spaced, unsightly line. There are many things that look
worse than a hyphen at the end of the last full line in a paragraph.
Avoidance of dividing the last word on a page, however, would justify even
bad spacing, because of the gain to the reader. In the last resort, the
interests of the reader must always have first consideration.

Division is greatly affected by the length of the measure. A long measure,
18 or 20 ems or more, gives greater opportunity for arranging the spacing,
but, on the other hand, makes division on short syllables conspicuous and
out of proportion. Very short register, as in two-column Bibles or in cases
where illustrations are inserted in the text, presents very great
difficulties and often calls for division which would not be allowable
elsewhere. Such cases often call for the exercise of the greatest care and
ingenuity.

It often happens that the author can be of great assistance to the printer
in making a handsome page. A change of a phrase, or even of a word will
avoid a difficulty which cannot be avoided by a printer except at the cost
of bad division or bad spacing. If the author is a sensible person he will
gladly cooperate with the printer in giving his thoughts clothing
appropriate to their intrinsic beauty and value. After the printer has
exhausted his resources he should not hesitate to carry his troubles to the
author.




DIVISION IN LINES OF DISPLAY


As a rule division is never used in lines of display. In these cases the
display is the important thing. Every word long enough to be divided is
important enough to be displayed and emphasized. Divided words are weakened
words. Lines of irregular lengths are used of set purpose.

In title pages words of bold display must never be divided. In minor lines
of display, such as subtitles and summaries, words are often divided. A
subheading of two lines should never be divided in the first line when it
is possible to turn the full word over on to the next line. The shortening
of the first line is never a blemish, but a too short second line following
a hyphened first line is always a fault.

There is a school of ultra-artistic composition in book titles which
affects a solid squaring up and hesitates at no means to secure its
effects. It sets a definite measure and forces the lines into it, dividing
words arbitrarily and using no hyphen. This is a passing fancy and will
pass as eccentricities always pass. It should not be used unless the author
insists upon it. The man who pays the bills has a right to have his work
done as he pleases. The intelligent printer, however, will not allow the
peculiarities of the individual customer to affect his general practice.

The pupil is referred to the appendix to DeVinne's "Correct Composition"
for rules for the division of French, German, and Spanish words. The same

As in the other volumes of this Part, the instructor should not content
himself with having the student learn the rules. He should give drills in
spelling and pronunciation and should give problems in composition
involving the application of rules. Constant and prolonged practice is
indispensable to proficiency in all these matters.




TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES FOR APPRENTICES


The following list of publications, comprising the TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL
SERIES FOR APPRENTICES, has been prepared under the supervision of the
Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America for use in trade
classes, in course of printing instruction, and by individuals.

Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or group of
authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide the printers of
the United States--employers, journeymen, and apprentices--with a
comprehensive series of handy and inexpensive compendiums of reliable,
up-to-date information upon the various branches and specialties of the
printing craft, all arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.

The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5×8 inches. Their
general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has been, as far as
practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief synopsis of the particular
contents and other chief features of each volume will be found under each
title in the following list.

Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to embody in each
publication as completely as possible all the rudimentary information and
essential facts necessary to an understanding of the subject. Care has been
taken to make all statements accurate and clear, with the purpose of
bringing essential information within the understanding of beginners in the
different fields of study. Wherever practicable, simple and well-defined
drawings and illustrations have been used to assist in giving additional
clearness to the text.

In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible help for use in
trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each title is accompanied by
a list of Review Questions covering essential items of the subject matter.
A short Glossary of technical terms belonging to the subject or department
treated is also added to many of the books.

These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of America.

Address all orders and inquiries to COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION, UNITED

ACKNOWLEDGMENT


This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of
America.

The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under whose
auspices the books have been prepared and published, acknowledges its
indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by the many authors,
printers, and others identified with this work.

While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of those
contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that a group
list of co-operating firms would be of interest.

The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes, constituting the
first printing. As soon as the entire list of books comprising the
Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which the Committee hopes
will be at an early date), the full list will be printed in each volume.

The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
