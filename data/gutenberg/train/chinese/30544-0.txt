陶潛-孝傳

天子孝傳贊

虞舜、夏禹、殷高宗、周文王。

虞舜父頑母嚚，事之於畎畝之間，以孝烝烝，是以堯聞而授之。富有天下，貴
為天子，以為不順於父母，若窮而無歸，惟（聞）〔順〕親可以得意，苟違朝
夕，若嬰兒之思戀，故稱舜五十而慕。《書》曰：「戛擊鳴球，搏拊琴瑟以詠
，祖考來格。」言思其來而訓之。愛敬盡於事親，是以德教加於百姓，刑於四
海。

夏禹有天下，以奉宗廟，然躬自菲薄，以厚其孝。孔子曰：「禹，吾無間然矣
。菲飲食而致孝乎鬼神，惡衣服而致美乎黻冕。」禹之德於是稱聞。聖人之德
，無以加於孝敬，孝敬之道，美莫大焉。

殷高宗諒陰，三年不言，百官?己而聽於?宰，三年而後言，天下咸歡，德教
大行，殷道以興。詩曰：「一人有慶，兆民賴之。」其此之謂乎！

周文王之為世子也，朝於王季日三，雞鳴至於寢門，問於內豎，內豎曰「安」
，文王乃喜，「不安」，則色憂，行不能正履。日中、暮，亦如之。食上，必
視寒溫之節；食下，必問所膳而後退。文王孝道光大，其化自近至遠，刑於寡
妻，以御於家邦，故得萬國之歡心，以事其先王矣。

贊曰：至哉後德，聖敬自天。陶漁致養，菲薄饗先。親瘠色憂，諒陰寢言。一
人有慶，千載賴旃。

諸侯孝傳贊

周公旦、魯孝公、河間惠王。

周公旦，武王之弟。成王幼少，周公攝政，制禮作樂，郊祀后稷以配天，宗祀
文王於明堂，以配上帝，是以四海之內，各以其職來祭。詩曰：「於穆清廟，
肅雍顯相。」言諸侯樂其位而敬其事也。仲尼曰：「孝莫大於嚴父，嚴父莫大
於配天。」則周公其人也，貴而不驕，位高彌謙，自承文武之休烈，孝道通於
神明，光被四海。武王封之於魯，備其禮樂，以奉宗廟焉。

魯孝公之為公子，周宣王問公子能道訓諸侯者立之。樊穆仲稱其孝曰：「肅恭
明神，而敬事耆老，賦事行刑，必問於遺訓，咨於故實，不干所問，不犯所咨
。」王曰：「然則能訓理其民矣。」乃命之於夷宮，是為孝公。夫宗廟致敬，
不忘親也，有國不亦宜乎！

漢河間惠王，獻王之曾孫也。西京藩臣，多驕放之失，其名德者，唯獻王，而
惠王繼之，《漢書》稱其能修獻王之行。母薨，服喪盡禮。哀帝下詔書褒揚，
以為宗室儀表，增封萬戶。禮，古之人皆然，至於末俗衰薄，固已賢矣，貴而
率禮又難。其見褒賞，不亦宜乎。

贊曰：貴驕殊途，不期而會。周公勞謙，乃成光大。二侯承魯，遵儉去泰。河
間率禮，漢宗是賴。

卿大夫孝傳贊

孔子、孟莊子、潁考叔。

孔子，魯人也。入則事父兄，出則事公卿，喪事不敢不勉，故稱曰：「孝乎惟
孝，友於兄弟，是亦為政也。」君賜腥，必熟而薦之，雖蔬食而齊，祭如在。
鄉人儺，朝服立於阼階，孝之至也。至德要道，莫大於孝，是以曾參受而書之
。游、夏之徒，常咨稟焉。許止不嘗藥，書以殺父。宰我暫言減喪，責以不仁
。言合訓典，行合世范。德義可尊，作事可法，遺文不朽，揚名千載。

孟莊子，魯人也。孔子稱其孝，其他可能也。其不改父之政，與父之臣，是難
能也。夫孝子之事親也，事亡如事存，故當不義則爭之，存所不爭，則亡亦不
敢改，〔三年無改〕父之道，猶謂之孝，況終身乎。

潁考叔，鄭人也。莊公以叔段之故，與母誓曰：「不及黃泉，無相見也。」既
而悔之。考叔為封人，聞之，有獻於公，公賜之食，而舍肉。公問之，對曰：
「小人有母，未嘗君之羹，請以遺之。」公曰：「汝有母遺，繄我獨無！」考
叔曰：「何謂也？」公語之故，且告之悔。考叔曰：「若掘地及泉隧而相見，
其誰曰不然？」公從之，遂為母子如初。君子曰：潁考叔，純孝也，愛其母而
施及莊公，詩云：「孝子不匱，永錫爾類。」其是之謂乎。

贊曰：仁惟本悌，聖亦基孝。恂恂尼父，固天攸造。二子承親，式禮遵誥。永
錫純懿，無改遺操。

士孝傳贊

高柴、樂正子春、孔奮、黃香。

高柴，衛人也。喪親，泣血三年，未嘗見齒，所謂哭不偯，言不文也。為武城
宰而化行，民有不服其親者改之，行喪如禮。君子之德風也，以身先之，而民
不遺其親。

樂正子春，魯人也。下堂傷足，既瘳，數月不出，猶有憂色。曰：「吾聞之曾
子，父母全而生之，已全而歸之，可謂孝矣。故君子一舉足，一出言，不敢忘
父母，不敢毀傷，孝之始也。」夫能敬慎若斯，而災患及者，未之有也。

孔奮，扶風人也。少以孝行著名州裡，供養至謹。在官，唯母極甘美，妻息菜
食。歷位以清。夫人情莫不欲厚其親，然亦有分焉，（奮）〔奢〕則難繼，能
致儉以全養者，鮮矣。

黃香，江夏人也。九歲失〔母〕，思慕骨立，事父竭力以致養，冬無被?而盡
滋味，暑則扇床枕，寒則以身溫席。漢和帝嘉之，特加異賜，歷位恭勤，寵祿
榮親，可謂「夙興夜寐，無忝爾所生」者也。

贊曰：顯允群士，行殊名鈞。咸能夙夜，以義榮親。率彼城邑，用化厥民。忠
以悟主，其孝乃純。

庶人孝傳贊

江革、廉范、汝郁、殷陶。

江革，齊人也。漢章帝時，避賊負母而逃，賊賢之，不害而告其生路。竭力傭
債，以致甘暖，和顏悅色，以盡歡心，欲親之安，自挽車以行。鄉人歸之，號
曰江巨孝。位至五官中郎將，天子嘉焉，寵遇甚厚。告歸，詔書褒美，就家禮
其終身，以顯異行。

廉范，京兆人也，少孤，十五入蜀，迎父喪，遇石舡覆，范執骸而沒，船人救
之，僅免於死，遂以喪歸。及仕郡拯太守於危難，送故盡節，章帝時為郡守，
百姓歌詠之。夫孝者，人之本，教之所由生也，是以范之臨危也勇，宰民也惠
，能以義顯也。

汝郁，陳郡人也。五歲，母病不食，郁亦不食。母憐之，強食。郁能察色，知
病，輒復不食。族人號曰「異童」。年十五，著於鄉里，父母終，思慕致毀，
推財與兄弟，隱於草澤，君子以為難。況童齔孝於自然，可謂天性也。

殷陶，汝南人也。年十二，以孝稱，遭父憂，率情合禮，有長蛇帶其門，舉家
奔走，陶以喪柩在（馬）〔焉〕，獨居廬不動。親戚扶持曉喻，莫能移之，（
帝）〔啼〕號益盛。由是顯名，屢辭辟命。夫智者不惑，勇者不懼，陶孝於其
親，而智勇並彰乎弱齡，斯又難矣。

贊曰：事親盡歡，其難在色。彼養以祿，我養以力。義在愛敬，榮不假飾。嗟
爾眾庶，鑑茲前式。

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
