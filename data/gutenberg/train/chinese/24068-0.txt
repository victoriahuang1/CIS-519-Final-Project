燕丹子卷上

燕太子丹質於秦，秦王遇之無禮，不得意，欲求歸。秦王不聽，謬言曰令烏白頭
、馬生角，乃可許耳。丹仰天歎，烏即白頭，馬生角。秦王不得已而遣之，為機
發之橋，欲陷丹。丹過之，橋為不發。夜到關，關門未開。丹為雞鳴，眾雞皆鳴
，遂得逃歸。深怨於秦，求欲復之。奉養勇士，無所不至。丹與其傅麴武書，曰
：「丹不肖，生於僻陋之國，長於不毛之地，未嘗得覩君子雅訓、達人之道也。
然鄙意欲有所陳，幸傅垂覽之。丹聞丈夫所恥，恥受辱以生於世也；貞女所羞，
羞見劫以虧其節也。故有刎喉不顧、據鼎不避者，斯豈樂死而忘生哉，其心有所
守也。今秦王反戾天常，虎狼其行，遇丹無禮，為諸侯最。丹每念之，痛入骨髓
。計燕國之眾不能敵之，曠年相守，力固不足。欲收天下之勇士，集海內之英雄
，破國空藏，以奉養之，重幣甘辭以市於秦。秦貪我賂，而信我辭，則一劍之任
，可當百萬之師；須臾之間，可解丹萬世之恥。若其不然，令丹生無面目於天下
，死懷恨於九泉。必令諸侯無以為歎，易水之北，未知誰有。此蓋亦子大夫之恥
也。謹遣書，願熟思之。」麴武報書曰：「臣聞快於意者虧於行，甘於心者傷於
性。今太子欲滅悁悁之恥，除久久之恨，此實臣所當麋軀碎首而不避也。私以為
智者不冀僥倖以要功，明者不苟從志以順心。事必成然後舉，身必安而後行。故
發無失舉之尤，動無蹉跌之媿也。太子貴匹夫之勇，信一劍之任，而欲望功，臣
以為疏。臣願合從於楚，并勢於趙，連衡於韓、魏，然後圖秦，秦可破也。且韓
、魏與秦，外親內疏。若有倡兵，楚乃來應，韓、魏必從，其勢可見。今臣計從
，太子之恥除，愚鄙之累解矣。太子慮之。」太子得書，不說，召麴武而問之。
武曰：「臣以為太子行臣言，則易水之北，永無秦憂，四鄰諸侯必有求我者矣。
」太子曰：「此引日縵縵，心不能須也！」麴武曰：「臣為太子計熟矣。夫有秦
，疾不如徐，走不如坐。今合楚、趙，并韓、魏，雖引歲月，其事必成。臣以為
良。」太子睡臥不聽。麴武曰：「臣不能為太子計。臣所知田光，其人深中有謀
。願令見太子。」太子曰：「敬諾！」

燕丹子卷中

田光見太子，太子側階而迎，迎而再拜。坐定，太子丹曰：「傅不以蠻域而丹不
肖，乃使先生來降弊邑。今燕國僻在北陲，比於蠻域，而先生不羞之。丹得侍左
右，睹見玉顏，斯乃上世神靈保祐燕國，令先生設降辱焉。」田光曰：「結髮立
身，以至於今，徒慕太子之高行，美太子之令名耳。太子將何以教之﹖」太子膝
行而前，涕淚橫流曰：「丹嘗質於秦，秦遇丹無禮，日夜焦心，思欲復之。論眾
則秦多，計強則燕弱。欲曰合從，心復不能。常食不識位，寢不安席。縱令燕秦
同日而亡，則為死灰復燃，白骨更生。願先生圖之。」田光曰：「此國事也，請
得思之。」於是舍光上館。太子三時進食，存問不絕，如是三月。太子怪其無說
，就光辟左右，問曰：「先生既垂哀恤，許惠嘉謀。側身傾聽，三月於斯，先生
豈有意歟﹖」田光曰：「微太子言，固將竭之。臣聞騏驥之少，力輕千里，及其
罷朽，不能取道。太子聞臣時已老矣。欲為太子良謀，則太子不能；欲奮筋力，
則臣不能。然竊觀太子客，無可用者。夏扶，血勇之人，怒而面赤；宋意，脈勇
之人，怒而面青；武陽，骨勇之人，怒而面白。光所知荊軻，神勇之人，怒而色
不變。為人博聞強記，體烈骨壯，不拘小節，欲立大功。嘗家於衛，脫賢大夫之
急十有餘人，其餘庸庸不可稱。太子欲圖事，非此人莫可。」太子下席再拜曰：
「若因先生之靈，得交於荊君，則燕國社稷長為不滅。唯先生成之。」田光遂行
。太子自送，執光手曰：「此國事，願勿洩之！」光笑曰：「諾。」遂見荊軻，
曰「光不自度不肖，達足下於太子。夫燕太子，真天下之士也，傾心於足下，願
足下勿疑焉。」荊軻曰：「有鄙志，常謂心向意投身不顧，情有異一毛不拔。今
先生令交於太子，敬諾不違。」田光謂荊軻曰：「蓋聞士不為人所疑。太子送光
之時，言此國事，願勿洩，此疑光也。是疑而生於世，光所羞也。」向軻吞舌而
死。軻遂之燕。

燕丹子卷下

荊軻之燕，太子自御，虛左，軻援綏不讓。自，坐定，賓客滿坐，軻言曰：「田
光褒揚太子仁愛之風，說太子不世之器，高行厲天，美聲盈耳。軻出衛都，望燕
路，歷險不以為勤，望遠不以為遐。今太子禮之以舊故之恩，接之以新人之敬，
所以不復讓者，士信於知己也。」太子曰：「田先生今無恙乎﹖」軻曰：「光臨
送軻之時，言太子戒以國事，恥以丈夫而不見信，向軻吞舌而死矣。」太子驚愕
失色，歔欷飲淚曰：「丹所以戒先生，豈疑先生哉。今先生自殺，亦令丹自棄於
世矣！」茫然良久，不怡民氏日太子置酒請軻，酒酣，太子起為壽。夏扶前曰：
「聞士無鄉曲之譽，則未可與論行；馬無服輿之伎，則未可與決良。今荊君遠至
，將何以教太子﹖」欲微感之。軻曰：「士有超世之行者，不必合於鄉曲；馬有
千里之相者，何必出於服輿。昔呂望當屠釣之時，天下之賤丈夫也；其遇文王，
則為周師。騏驥之在鹽車，駑之下也；及遇伯樂，則有千里之功。如此在鄉曲而
後發善，服輿而後別良哉！」夏扶問荊軻：「何以教太子﹖」軻曰：「將令燕繼
召公之跡，追甘棠之化，高欲令四三王，下欲令六五霸。於君何如也﹖」坐皆稱
善。竟酒，無能屈。太子甚喜，自以得軻，永無秦憂。後日與軻之東宮，臨池而
觀。軻拾瓦投龜，太子令人奉槃金。軻用抵，抵盡復進。軻曰：「非為太子愛金
也，但臂痛耳。」後復共乘千里馬。軻曰：「聞千里馬肝美。」太子即殺馬進肝
。暨樊將軍得罪於秦，秦求之急，乃來歸太子。太子為置酒華陽之臺。酒中，太
子出美人能琴者。軻曰：「好手琴者！」太子即進之。軻曰：「但愛其手耳。」
太子即斷其手，盛以玉槃奉之。太子常與軻同案而食，同床而寢。後日，軻從容
曰：「軻侍太子，三年於斯矣，而太子遇軻甚厚，黃金投龜，千里馬肝，姬人好
手，盛以玉槃。凡庸人當之，猶尚樂出尺寸之長，當犬馬之用。今軻常侍君子之
側，聞烈士之節，死有重於太山，有輕於鴻毛者，但問用之所在耳。太子幸教之
。」太子斂袂，正色而言曰：「丹嘗遊秦，秦遇丹不道，丹恥與俱生。今荊君不
以丹不肖，降辱小國。今丹以社稷干長者，不知所謂。」軻曰：「今天下彊國莫
彊於秦。今太子力不能威諸侯，諸侯未肯為太子用也。太子率燕國之眾而當之，
猶使羊將狼，使狼追虎耳。」太子曰：「丹之憂計久，不知安出﹖」軻曰：「樊
於期得罪於秦，秦求之急。又督亢之地，秦所貪也。今得樊於期首、督亢地圖，
則事可成也。」太子曰：「若事可成，舉燕國而獻之，丹甘心焉。樊將軍以窮歸
我，而丹賣之，心不忍也。」軻默然不應。居五月，太子恐軻悔，見軻曰：「今
秦已破趙國，兵臨燕，事已迫急。雖欲足下計，安施之﹖今欲先遣武陽，何如﹖
」軻怒曰：「何太子所遣，往而不返者，豎子也！軻所以未行者，待吾客耳。」
於是軻潛見樊於期曰：「聞將軍得罪於秦，父母妻子皆見焚燒，求將軍邑萬戶、
金千斤。軻為將軍痛之。今有一言，除將軍之辱，解燕國之恥，將軍豈有意乎﹖
」於期曰：「常念之，日夜飲淚，不知所出。荊君幸教，願聞命矣！」軻曰：「
今願得將軍之首，與燕督亢地圖進之，秦王必喜。喜必見軻，軻因左手把其袖，
右手椹其胸，數以負燕之罪，責以將軍之讎。而燕國見陵雪，將軍積忿之怒除矣
。」於期起，扼腕執刀曰：「是於期日夜所欲，而今聞命矣！」於是自剄，頭墜
背後，兩目不瞑。太子聞之，自駕馳往，伏於期屍而哭，悲不自勝。良久，無奈
何，遂函盛於期首與燕督亢地圖以獻秦，武陽為副。荊軻入秦，不擇日而發，太
子與知謀者皆素衣冠送之，於易水之上。荊軻起為壽，歌曰：「風蕭蕭兮易水寒
，壯士一去兮不復還。」高漸離擊筑，宋意和之。為壯聲則髮怒衝冠，為哀聲則
士皆流涕。二人皆升車，終已不顧也。二子行過，夏扶當車前刎頸以送。二子行
過陽翟，軻買肉爭輕重，屠者辱之，武陽欲擊，軻止之。西入秦，至咸陽，因中
庶子蒙白曰：「燕太子丹畏大王之威，今奉樊於期首與督亢地圖，願為北蕃臣妾
。」秦王喜。百官陪位，陛戟數百，見燕使者。軻奉於期首，武陽奉地圖。鐘鼓
並發，群臣皆呼萬歲。武陽大恐，兩足不能相過，面如死灰色。秦王怪之。軻顧
武陽前，謝曰：「北蕃蠻夷之鄙人，未見天子。願陛下少假借之，使得畢事於前
。」秦王曰：「軻起，督亢圖進之。」秦王發圖，圖窮而匕首出。軻左手把秦王
袖，右手椹其胸，數之曰：「足下負燕日久，貪暴海內，不知厭足。於期無罪而
夷其族。軻將海內報讎。今燕王母病，與軻促期，從吾計則生，不從則死。」秦
王曰：「今日之事，從子計耳！乞聽琴聲而死。」召姬人鼓琴，琴聲曰：「羅縠
單衣，可掣而絕。八尺屏風，可超而越。鹿盧之劍，可負而拔。」軻不解音。秦
王從琴聲負劍拔之，於是奮袖超屏風而走，軻拔匕首擿之，決秦王，耳入銅柱，
火出。秦王還斷軻兩手。軻因倚柱而笑，箕踞而罵，曰：「吾坐輕易，為豎子所
欺。燕國之不報，我事之不立哉！」

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
