Title: Gushi shijiu shou 古詩十九首 (Nineteen Ancient Poems)

Author: 蕭統 (Tong Xiao)




古詩十九首之一《行行重行行》
行行重行行，與君生別離。相去萬餘裏，各在天一涯。道路阻且長，會面安可知。胡馬依北風，越鳥巢南枝。
相去日已遠，衣帶日已緩。浮雲蔽白日，遊子不顧返。思君令人老，歲月忽已晚。棄捐勿復道，努力加餐飯。

古詩十九首之二《青青河畔草》
青青河畔草，鬱鬱園中柳。盈盈樓上女，皎皎當窗牖。
娥娥紅粉妝，纖纖出素手。昔為娼家女，今為蕩子夫。蕩子行不歸，空床難獨守。

古詩十九首之三《青青陵上柏》
青青陵上柏，磊磊澗中石。人生天地間，忽如遠行客。鬥酒相娛樂，聊厚不為薄。驅車策駑馬，遊戲宛與洛。
洛中何鬱鬱，冠帶自相索。長衢羅夾巷，王侯多第宅。兩宮遙相望，雙闕百餘尺。極宴娛心意，戚戚何所迫？

古詩十九首之四《今日良宴會》
今日良宴會，歡樂難具陳。彈箏奮逸響，新聲妙入神。令德唱高言，識曲聽其真。齊心同所願，含意俱未申。
人生寄一世，奄忽若飆塵。何不策高足，先據要路津。無為守貧賤，坎軻長苦辛。

古詩十九首之五《西北有高樓》
西北有高樓，上與浮雲齊。交疏結綺窗，阿閣三重階。上有弦歌聲，音響一何悲！誰能為此曲，無乃杞梁妻。
清商隨風發，中曲正徘徊。一彈再三嘆，慷慨有餘哀。不惜歌者苦，但傷知音稀。願為雙鴻鵠，奮翅起高飛。

古詩十九首之六《涉江采芙蓉》
涉江采芙蓉，蘭澤多芳草。采之欲遺誰，所思在遠道。還顧望舊鄉，長路漫浩浩。同心而離居，憂傷以終老。

古詩十九首之七《明月皎夜光》
明月皎夜光，促織鳴東壁。玉衡指孟冬，眾星何歷歷。白露沾野草，時節忽復易。秋蟬鳴樹間，玄鳥逝安適。
昔我同門友，高舉振六翮。不念攜手好，棄我如遺跡。南箕北有鬥，牽牛不負軛。良無盤石固，虛名復何益？

古詩十九首之八《冉冉孤生竹》
冉冉孤生竹，結根泰山阿。與君為新婚，兔絲附女蘿。兔絲生有時，夫婦會有宜。千里遠結婚，悠悠隔山陂。
思君令人老，軒車來何遲！傷彼蕙蘭花，含英揚光輝。過時而不采，將隨秋草萎。君亮執高節，賤妾亦何為！

古詩十九首之九《庭中有奇樹》
庭中有奇樹，綠葉發華滋。攀條折其榮，將以遺所思。馨香盈懷袖，路遠莫致之。此物何足貴，但感別經時。

古詩十九首之十《迢迢牽牛星》
迢迢牽牛星，皎皎河漢女。纖纖擢素手，札札弄機杼。終日不成章，泣涕零如雨。
河漢清且淺，相去復幾許。盈盈一水間，脈脈不得語。

古詩十九首之十一《回車駕言邁》
回車駕言邁，悠悠涉長道。四顧何茫茫，東風搖百草。所遇無故物，焉得不速老。
盛衰各有時，立身苦不早。人生非金石，豈能長壽考？奄忽隨物化，榮名以為寶。

古詩十九首之十二《東城高且長》
東城高且長，逶迤自相屬。回風動地起，秋草萋已綠。四時更變化，歲暮一何速！晨風懷苦心，蟋蟀傷局促。
蕩滌放情志，何為自結束！燕趙多佳人，美者顏如玉。被服羅裳衣，當戶理清曲。音響一何悲！弦急知柱促。
馳情整巾帶，沈吟聊躑躅。思為雙飛燕，銜泥巢君屋。

古詩十九首之十三《驅車上東門》
驅車上東門，遙望郭北墓。白楊何蕭蕭，松柏夾廣路。下有陳死人，杳杳即長暮。潛寐黃泉下，千載永不寤。
浩浩陰陽移，年命如朝露。人生忽如寄，壽無金石固。萬歲更相送，賢聖莫能度。服食求神仙，多為藥所誤。
不如飲美酒，被服紈與素。

古詩十九首之十四《去者日以疏》
去者日以疏，生者日已親。出郭門直視，但見丘與墳。古墓犁為田，松柏摧為薪。
白楊多悲風，蕭蕭愁殺人！思還故里閭，欲歸道無因。

古詩十九首之十五《生年不滿百》
生年不滿百，常懷千歲憂。晝短苦夜長，何不秉燭遊！為樂當及時，何能待來茲？
愚者愛惜費，但為後世嗤。卡人王子喬，難可蜿等期。

古詩十九首之十六《凜凜歲雲暮》
凜凜歲雲暮，螻蛄夕鳴悲。涼風率已厲，遊子寒無衣。錦衾遺洛浦，同袍與我違。獨宿累長夜，夢想見容輝。
良人惟古歡，枉駕惠前綏。願得常巧笑，攜手同車歸。既來不須臾，又不處重闈。亮無晨風翼，焉能淩風飛？
眄睞以適意，引領遙相希。徒倚懷感傷，垂涕沾雙扉。

古詩十九首之十七《孟冬寒氣至》
孟冬寒氣至，北風何慘栗。愁多知夜長，仰觀眾星列。三五明月滿，四五蟾兔缺。客從遠方來，遺我一書劄。
上言長相思，下言久離別。置書懷袖中，三歲字不滅。一心抱區區，懼君不識察。

古詩十九首之十八】《客從遠方來》
客從遠方來，遺我一端綺。相去萬餘里，故人心尚爾。文彩雙鴛鴦，裁為合歡被。
著以長相思，緣以結不解。以膠投漆中，誰能別離此？

古詩十九首之十九《明月何皎皎》
明月何皎皎，照我羅床緯。憂愁不能寐，攬衣起徘徊。客行雖雲樂，不如早旋歸。
出戶獨彷徨，愁思當告誰！引領還入房，淚下沾裳衣。

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
