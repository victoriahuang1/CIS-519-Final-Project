提要

臣等謹案：《宅經二卷》，舊本題曰黄帝撰。案：《漢志》形法家有
《宫宅地形二十卷》，則相宅之書，較相墓為古。然《隋志》有《宅
吉凶論三卷》、《相宅圖八卷》，《舊唐志》有《五姓宅經二卷》，
皆不云出黄帝，是書盖依託也。考書中稱《黄帝二宅經》及淮南子、
李淳風、吕才等《宅經》二十有九種，則作書之時，本不偽稱黄帝，
特方技之流欲神其説，詭題黄帝作耳。其法分二十四路考尋休咎，以
八卦之位向乾坎艮震及辰為陽，巽離坤兑及戌為隂，陽以亥為首、巳
為尾，隂以巳為首、亥為尾，而主於隂陽相得，頗有義理，文辭亦皆
雅馴。《宋史藝文志》五行類有《相宅經一巻》，疑即此書，在術數
之中猶最為近古者矣。乾隆四十六年十月恭校上。

宅經卷上

夫宅者，乃是隂陽之樞紐，人倫之軌模，非夫博物明賢而能悟斯道也
。就此五種，其最要者唯，有宅法而真秘術。凡人所居，無不在宅，
雖只大小不等，隂陽有殊，縱然客居一室之中，亦有善惡。大者大説
，小者小論，犯者有災，鎮而禍止，猶藥病之效也。故宅者，人之本
，人以宅為家居，若安即家代昌吉，若不安即門族衰微。墳墓川岡，
並同兹説，上之軍國，次及州郡縣邑，下之村坊署柵乃至山居，但人
所處皆其例焉，目見耳聞古制非一。

《黄帝二宅經》、《地典宅經》、《三元宅經》、《文王宅經》、《
孔子宅經》、《宅錦》、《宅撓》、《宅統》、《宅鏡》、《天老宅
經》、《劉根宅經》、《玄女宅經》、《司馬天師宅經》、《淮南子
宅經》、《王微宅經》、《司最宅經》、《劉晉平宅經》、《張子毫
宅經》、《八卦宅經》、《五兆宅經》、《玄悟宅經》、《六十四卦
宅經》、《右盤龍宅經》、《李淳風宅經》、《五姓宅經》、《呂才
宅經》、《飛陰亂伏宅經》、《子夏金門宅經》、《刁曇宅經》。

已上諸經其皆大同小異，亦皆自言秘妙，互推短長，若不遍求，即用
之不足。

近來學者，多攻五姓八宅，黄道白方，例皆違犯大經，未免災咎。所
以人犯修動，致令造者不居，却毁陰陽而無據效，豈不痛哉！況先賢
垂籍，誡勗昭彰，人自冥蒙，日用而不識其象者。日月乾坤，寒暑雌
雄，晝夜陰陽等，所以包羅萬象，舉一千從，運變無形而能化物，大
矣哉，陰陽之理也。經之陰者，生化物情之母也；陽者，生化物情之
父也。作天地之祖，為孕育之尊，順之則亨，逆之則否，何異公忠受
爵，違命變殃者乎！今採諸秘驗，分為二十四路，八卦九宫，配女男
之位，宅陰陽之界，考尋休咎，並無出前二宅。此實養生靈之聖法也
。

二十四路者，隨宅大小，中院分四面作二十四路，十干十二支乾艮坤
巽，共為二十四路，是也。乾將三男震坎艮，悉屬於陽位(即從西北
乾位之震為陽明矣)，坤將三女巽離兊，悉屬陰之位(即從東南巽角順
之戌為陰明矣)，是以陽不獨王，以陰為得(陽宅為宜修陰方
)，陰不獨王，以陽為得(如上說)，亦如冬以温暖為徳，夏以凉冷為徳
，男以女為徳，女以男為徳之義，《易訣》云：陰得陽，如暑得凉，
五姓咸和，百事俱昌。所以，徳位髙壯藹宻，即吉。重陰重陽則凶，
陽宅更招東方北方，陰宅更招西方南方為重也(是東面為辰南，西面
為戌北之位，斜分一條為陰陽之界)。

凡之陽宅，即有陽氣抱陰，陰宅即有陰氣抱陽。陰陽之宅者，即龍也
。陽宅龍頭在亥，尾在巳；陰宅龍頭在巳，尾在亥(其狀在龍者，陰
龍青、陽龍赤，各有命坐，切忌犯也)。凡從巽向乾、從午向子、從
坤向艮、從酉向夘、從戌向辰移(已上移轉及上官所住，不計逺近，
悉入陽也)，從乾向巽、從子向午、從艮向坤、從卯向酉、從辰向戌
移(已上移轉及上官悉名入陰)。故福徳之方，勤依天道天徳月徳，生
氣到其位，即修，令清潔闊厚，即一家獲安，榮華富貴(天之福徳者
，宅之財命也，財命既壯，何愁不榮，故須勤修)。再入陰入陽，是
名無氣，三度重入陰陽，謂之無魂；四入謂之無魄；魂魄既無，即家
破逃散，子孫絶後也(經云：連犯不止，滅門絶嗣，此之謂也)。

若一陰陽往來，即合天道，自然吉昌之象也。設要重往，即須逐道住
四十五日、七十五日，往之无咎，仍宜生氣福徳之方始吉。更犯五鬼
，絶命刑禍者，尤不利。訣云：行不得度，不如復故，斯之謂也。

又云：其宅乃窮，急翻故宫。宜拆刑禍方，舍却益福徳方也。又云：
翻宅平牆，可為銷殃(宅之行年不利或口舌疾病等，即宜翻刑禍，添
益福徳，改移牆壁，即消災，致其大吉昌也)。夫辨宅者，皆取移來
方位，不以街北街東為陽(不妨是陽之位作陰宅居之即吉)，街南街西
為陰(不妨作陽宅居之吉)。凡移來不勒逺近，一里百里千里十步與百
步同。又此二宅修造，唯看天道天徳月徳，生氣到即修之不避，將軍
、太嵗、豹尾、黄幡、黑方及音姓宜忌，順陰陽二氣為正，此諸神殺
及五姓六十甲子，皆從二氣而生，列在方隅，直一年公事，故不為災
(凡諸刑殺在刑禍方者，設天徳月徳到，亦須避之；若神殺在宅福徳
方，即待天徳月徳生氣到其位，便須修之，用功多即善，故不避也。
若不明隂陽之氣，到其位便須修之，用功多即善，故不避也，若不明
氣中小數，故不能制其大綱)。

又云：刑禍之方缺復荒，福徳之方連接長，吉也(又云：刑禍方牆舍
位宜狹薄，誡之髙壯也，福徳方及牆舍人家宜連接壯實也)。又云：
刑禍之方縮復縮，猶恐災殃枉相逐，福徳之方拓復拓，子子孫孫受榮
樂(刑禍之方戒侵拓也，不得太縮，縮即氣不足，不足則損財祿；福
徳之方宜戒侵拓也，亦不得太過，太過即減福會，至微不消，厚福所
臨也。凡事足太過，所侵拓之數過於本宅，名曰太過)。

又云：宅有五虚，令人貧耗；五實，令人富貴。宅大人少，一虚；宅
門大内小，二虚；牆院不完，三虚；井竈不處，四虚；宅地多屋少庭
院廣，五虚。宅小人多，一實；宅大門小，二實；牆院完全，三實；
宅小六畜多，四實；宅水溝東南流，五實。又云：宅乃漸昌，勿棄宫
堂，不衰莫移，故為受殃。舍居就廣，未必有歡，計口半造，必得夀
考(宅不宜廣)。又云：其田雖良，薅鋤乃芳，其宅雖善，修移乃昌。

《宅統》之宅墓，以象榮華之源，得利者所作遂心，失利者妄生反心
。墓凶宅吉，子孫官祿；墓吉宅凶，子孫衣食不足；墓宅俱吉，子孫
榮華；墓宅俱凶，子孫移鄉絶種，先靈譴責，地禍常併，七世亡魂，
悲憂受苦，子孫不立，零落他鄉，流轉如蓬，客死河岸。《青烏子》
云：其宅得墓二神，漸護子孫，祿位乃固。得地得墓，龍驤虎步，物
業滋川，財集倉庫，子孫忠孝，天神祐助。子夏云：墓有四奇，商角
二姓，丙壬乙辛，宫羽徴三姓，甲庚丁癸。得地得宫，刺史王公，朱
衣紫綬，世貴名雄。得地失宫，有始無終，先人受苦，子孫當凶。失
地得宫，子孫不窮，雖無基業，衣食過充，失地失宫，絶嗣無蹤，行
求衣食，客死蒿蓬。子夏云：人因宅而立，宅因人得存，人宅相扶，
感通天地，故不可獨信命也。

凡修宅次第法

先修刑禍，後修福徳即吉；先修福徳，後修刑禍即凶。陰宅從巳起功
順轉，陽宅從亥起功順轉。刑禍方用一百工，福徳方用二百工，壓之
即吉。陽宅多修於外，陰宅多修於内。或者取子午分陰陽之界，悞將
甚也。此是二氣潛通，運迴之數不同，八卦九宫，分形列象，配男女
之位也(冬至巳、夏至亥，是陰陽起盛之極處，不同聖人於地面上畫
八卦，列女男之宫。宫者，宅也，巽為長女，屬陰；乾為天，天為陽
明矣
)。其有長才深智，慜物愛生，敬曉斯門，其利莫測，且大犯即家破
逃散，小犯則失爵亡官，其餘雜犯，火光口舌，跛蹇偏枯，衰殃疾病
等，萬般皆有，豈得輕之哉！犯處逺而慢，即半年一年二年三年始發
，犯處近而緊，即七十五日四十五日或不出月即發。若見此圖者，自
然悟會，不問愚智，福徳自修。災殃不犯，官榮進達，財食豐盈，六
畜獲安，又歸天夀，金玉之獻，未足為珍，利濟之徒，莫大於此，可
以家藏一本，用誡子孫，祕而寶之，可名《宅鏡》。

又宅書云：拆故營新，爻卜相伏，移南徙北，陰陽交分，是和陰陽者
，氣也，逐人得變吉凶者，化也。隨事能興，故天地運轉無窮。人畜
鬼神，變化何準。

《摉神記》云：精靈鬼魅，皆化為人。或有人自相感變為妖怪，亦如
異性之
木，接續而生，根苗雖殊，異味相雜，形礙之物。尚隨變通，陰陽虚
無，豈為常定?是知宅非宅氣，由移來以變之。

又云：宅以形勢為身體，以泉水為血脈，以土地為皮肉，以草木為毛
髪，以舍屋為衣服，以門户為冠帶，若得如斯，是事儼雅，乃為上吉
。

《三元經》云：地善即苗茂，宅吉即人榮。又云：人之福者，喻如美
貌之人，宅之吉者，如醜陋之子得好衣裳，神彩尤添一半；若命薄宅
惡，即如醜人更又衣弊，如何堪也。故人之居宅，大須慎擇。

又云：修來路即無不吉，犯抵路未嘗安。假如近從東來，入此宅住後
，更修拓西方，名抵路，卻修拓東方，名來路。餘方移轉及上官往來
，不計逺近，準此為例。凡人婚嫁，買莊田六畜，致營域上官求利等
，悉宜向宅福徳方往來。久久吉慶；若為刑禍方往來，久久不利。又
忌龜頭廳在午地，向北衝堂，名曰凶亭，有稍髙豎屋，亦不利。訣云
：龜頭午，必易主。亦云妨主。諸院有之亦不吉。凡宅午巳東巽，已
來有髙樓大榭，皆不利，宜去之吉。

又云：凡欲修造動治，須避四王神，亦名帝車帝輅帝舍。假如春三月
，東方為青帝，木王，寅為車，卯為輅，辰為舍，即是正月二月三月
不得東。《戸經》曰：犯帝車殺父，犯帝輅殺母，犯帝舍殺子孫。夏
及秋冬三箇月倣此為忌。

又云：每年有十二月，毎月有生氣死氣之位。但修月生氣之位者，福
來集，月生氣與天道月徳，合其吉，路犯月，死氣之位為有凶災。

正月生氣在子癸，死氣在午丁；二月生氣在丑艮，死氣在未坤；三月
生氣在寅甲，死氣在申庚；四月生氣在夘乙，死氣在酉辛；五月生氣
在辰巽，死氣在戌乾；六月生氣在巳丙，死氣在亥壬；七月生氣在午
丁，死氣在子癸；八月生氣在未坤，死氣在丑艮；九月生氣在申庚，
死氣在寅甲；十月生氣在酉辛，死氣在卯乙；十一月生氣在戌乾，死
氣在辰巽；十二月生氣在亥壬，死氣在巳丙 。

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
