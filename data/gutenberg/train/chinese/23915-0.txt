虬髯客傳 

隋煬帝之幸江都也，命司空楊素守西京。素驕貴，又以時亂，天下之權重望崇者
莫我若也，奢貴自奉，禮異人臣。每公卿入言，賓客上謁，未嘗不踞床而見，令
美人捧出，侍婢羅列，頗僭於上，末年益甚，無復知所負荷、有扶危持顛之心。

一日，衛公李靖以布衣來謁，獻奇策，素亦踞見之。靖前揖曰：「天下方亂，英
雄競起，公以帝室重臣，須以收羅豪傑為心，不宜踞見賓客。」素斂容而起，與
語大悅，收其策而退。

當靖之騁辯也，一妓有殊色，執紅拂立於前，獨目靖。靖既去，而執拂妓臨軒，
指吏問曰：「去者處士第幾？住何處？」吏具以對，妓頷而去。

靖歸逆旅，其夜五更初，忽聞叩門而聲低者，靖起問焉。乃紫衣戴帽人，杖揭一
囊。靖問：「誰？」曰：「妾楊家之紅拂妓也。」靖遽延入。脫衣去帽，乃十八
九佳麗人也。素面華衣而拜。靖驚，答曰：「妾侍楊司空久，閱天下之人多矣，
未有如公者。絲蘿非獨生，願託喬木，故來奔耳。」靖曰：「楊司空權重京師，
如何？」曰：「彼屍居餘氣，不足畏也。諸妓知其無成，去者眾矣。彼亦不甚逐
也。計之詳矣。幸無疑焉。」問其姓，曰：「張。」問伯仲之次，曰：「最長。
」觀其肌膚、儀狀、言詞、氣性，真天人也。靖不自意獲之，愈喜懼，瞬息萬慮
不安，而窺戶者足無停屨。既數日，聞追訪之聲，意亦非峻，乃雄服乘馬，排闥
而去，將歸太原。

行次靈石旅舍，既設床，爐中烹肉且熟，張氏以髮長委地，立梳床前。靖方刷馬
，忽有一人，中形，赤髯而虬，乘蹇驢而來，投革囊於爐前，取枕敧臥，看張氏
梳頭。靖怒甚，未決，猶刷馬。張熟視其面，一手握髮，一手映身搖示，令勿怒
。急急梳頭畢，斂衽前問其姓。臥客答曰：「姓張。」對曰：「妾亦姓張，合是
妹。」遽拜之。問：「第幾？」曰：「第三。」問：「妹第幾？」曰：「最長。
」遂喜曰：「今日多幸，遇一妹。」張氏遙呼曰：「李郎且來拜三兄！」靖驟拜
之，遂環坐。曰：「煮者何肉？」曰：「羊肉，計已熟矣。」客曰：「飢甚！靖
出市胡餅。客抽匕首，切肉共食。食竟，餘肉亂切送驢前食之，甚速。客曰：「
觀李郎之行，貧士也，何以致斯異人。」曰：「靖雖貧，亦有心者焉。他人見問
，固不言，兄之問，則無隱耳。」具言其由。曰：「然則將何之？」曰：「將避
地太原耳。」曰：「然，吾故謂非君所能致也。」曰：「有酒乎？」曰：「主人
西則酒肆也。」靖取酒一斗，酒既巡，客曰：「吾有少下酒物，李郎能同之乎？
」靖曰：「不敢。」於是開革囊，取一人頭並心肝，卻收頭囊中，以匕首切心肝
共食之。曰：「此人天下負心者，銜之十年，今始獲，吾憾釋矣。」又曰：「觀
李郎儀形器宇，真丈夫也。亦知太原有異人乎？」曰：「嘗見一人，愚謂之真人
也。其餘，將相而已。」曰：「何姓？」曰：「靖之同姓。」曰：「年幾？」曰
：「近二十。」曰：「今何為？」曰：「州將之愛子也。」曰：「似矣，亦須見
之，李郎能致吾一見否？」曰：「靖之友劉文靜者與之狎，因文靜見之可也。兄
欲何為？」曰：「望氣者言太原有奇氣，使吾訪之。李郎明發，何日到太原？」
靖計之。曰：「某日當到。」曰：「達之明日，方曙，候我於汾陽橋。」言訖，
乘驢而去，其行若飛，回顧已遠。公與張氏且驚懼，久之，曰：「烈士不欺人，
固無畏。」促鞭而行。

及期，入太原候之，相見大喜，偕詣劉氏，詐謂文靜曰：「有善相者思見郎君，
請迎之。」文靜素奇其人，一旦聞有客善相，遽致酒延焉。既而太宗至，不衫不
屨，裼裘而來，神氣揚揚，貌與常異。虬髯默居坐末，見之心死。飲數巡，起招
靖曰：「真天子也。」靖以告劉，劉益喜，自負。既出，而虬髯曰：「吾得十八
九矣，然須道兄見之。李郎宜與一妹復入京，某日午時，訪我於馬行東酒樓下。
下有此驢及一瘦騾，即我與道兄俱在其上矣，到即登焉。」又別而去，公與張氏
復應之。及期訪焉，即見二乘。攬衣登樓，虯髯與一道士方對飲，見靖驚喜，召
坐環飲。十數巡。曰：「樓下櫃中有錢十萬，擇一深隱處，駐一妹畢，某日復會
我於汾陽橋。」

如期至，道士與虬髯已先坐矣。俱謁文靜。時方弈棋，起揖而語。少焉，文靜飛
書迎文皇看棋。道士對弈，虯髯與靖旁侍焉。俄而文皇來，精采驚人，長揖就坐
，神清氣朗，滿坐風生，顧盼暐如也。道士一見慘然，斂棋子曰：「此局全輸矣
！於此失卻局，奇哉！救無路矣！復奚言！」罷弈請去，既出，謂虬髯曰：「此
世界非公世界也，他方可圖，勉之；勿以為念！」因共入京。虬髯曰：「計李郎
之程，某日方到。到之明日，可與一妹同詣某坊曲小宅相訪。李郎相從，一妹懸
然如磐，欲令新婦袛謁，兼議從容，無前卻也。」言畢，吁嗟而去。

靖策馬遄征，即到京，遂與張氏同往，乃一小板門，叩之，有應者拜曰：「三郎
令候李郎、一娘子久矣。」延入重門，門益壯麗，婢四十人羅列庭前，奴二十人
引靖入東廳。廳之陳設，窮極珍異，箱中妝奩冠鏡首飾之盛，非人間之物。巾櫛
妝飾畢，請更衣，衣又珍奇。既畢，傳云：「三郎來！」「乃虬髯紗帽裼裘而來
，有龍虎之姿，相見歡然。催其妻出拜，蓋亦天人也。遂延中堂，陳設盤筵之盛
，雖王公家不侔也。四人對饌訖，陳女樂二十人，列奏於前。飲食妓樂，若從天
降，非人間之曲度，食畢，行酒。家人自東堂舁出二十床，各以錦繡帕覆之，既
陳，盡去其帕，乃文簿鎖匙耳。虬髯謂曰：「此盡是寶貨泉貝之數，吾之所有，
悉以充贈。何者？某本欲於此世界求事，或當龍戰三二十載，建少功業。今既有
主，住亦何為？太原李氏，真英主也。三五年內，即當太平。李郎以英特之才，
輔清平之主，竭心盡善，必極人臣。一妹以天人之姿，蘊不世之藝，從夫而貴，
榮極軒裳。非一妹不能識李郎，非李郎不能榮一妹。聖賢起陸之漸，際會如期。
虎嘯風生，龍吟雲萃，固非偶然也。將余之贈，以佐真主，贊功業。勉之哉！此
後十餘年，當東南數千里外有異事，是吾得志之秋也。一妹與李郎可瀝酒東南相
賀。」因命家童列拜曰：「李郎、一妹，是汝主也。」言訖，與其妻從一奴戎裝
乘馬而去；數步，遂不復見。

靖據其宅，遂為豪家，得以助文皇締構之資，遂匡天下。

貞觀十年，靖位至左僕射平章事，適東南蠻入奏曰：「有海船千艘，甲兵十萬，
入扶餘國，殺其主自立。國已定矣。」靖心知虬髯得事也，歸告張氏，具禮相賀
，瀝酒東南祝拜之。乃知真人之興也，非英雄所冀，況非英雄者乎？人臣之謬思
亂者，乃螳臂之拒走輪耳。我皇家垂福萬葉，豈虛然哉！或曰：「衛公之兵法，
半是虬髯所傳也。」

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
