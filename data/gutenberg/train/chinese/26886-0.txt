　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　梁公九諫

                               [宋]　佚名


　　序

　　唐中宗皇帝，姓李，諱哲，高宗皇帝之子，母曰則天順聖皇后，姓武氏。
先是高宗在位歲久，多苦風疾，不能視朝，百司奏事，皆委則天詳決。則天素
多計智，兼涉文史，自此內輔國政，威勢與帝無異。當時稱二聖。高宗崩，中
宗即位，未及一月，為裴炎所僭，廢為廬陵王，貶均州。明年又徙房州。則天
女主冠冕，法服臨御，以治天下，改唐稱周二十年。於是悉封諸武為王，殺唐
之子孫殆盡，堅欲傳位與姪武三思。當時之時，諸武之勢燄如烈火，李唐之族
冷如寒灰，何心不隨？何力可回？且中宗豈有復返者乎？且不死為幸爾！賴我
梁公貞社稷之臣，捨死不顧，直言極諫，屢以母子性天之道為言，使則天感悟
，遂遣使往房州召還，立為皇太子。故中宗得復帝位，而唐祚不移者，皆梁公
之力也。
　　昔呂溫頌曰：
　　　　取日虞淵，洗光咸池，潛授五龍，夾日以飛。
忠心與日月同明，本傳與天地同其久然。而世有《梁公九諫》詞者，即趙歧所
謂外堂也。傳述既久，舊本多謬，與本傳互有同異，觀者不能無憾。今三復參
考，訂其訛而補其闕，不愆不忘，率由舊章，倘博古君子別求明本而正諸，不
亦宜乎！

　　第一諫

　　則天皇帝臨御，廢東宮太子為廬陵王，遂貶房州千里，卻立武三思為儲君
。一日會朝，問：「諸卿等意是如何？」諸大臣盡皆拜舞謝敕，山呼萬歲，皆
稱：「賀得人矣！」惟有宰相狄公不拜。則天問狄相曰：「策立武三思之事，
諸大臣盡皆拜舞謝敕，惟有卿不拜，朕想，卿必有異議。縱有異議，豈勝得殿
前八十二員大臣？」狄相奏曰：「不然。若得殿前八十二員大臣比並，事當不
可。觀這八十二員大臣見解，似鶴鳩抱卵，豈知鸞鳳之志；螻蟻攻土，豈知晦
朔之朝？磨磚作鏡，焉可鑒容；鉛錫為刀，豈堪琢玉？狐狸似犬，愚者養之；
苦蔞似瓜，愚者食之。臣觀諸臣，何以異於此？」則天問曰：「問卿策立之事
，卿如何將此比並諸大臣？」狄相奏曰：「且如紫微之殿，不是陛下所居之殿
。陛下是武家宗祖，唐家國后。緣太子年幼，權請陛下主國，太子長成，社稷
合歸唐家枝葉。今諸大臣，未有一人勸陛下以母而立子，卻賀陛下以姑而立姪
，是大臣所見不明，陛下所用非賢，故以此事比並諸大臣。據愚臣見解，能斬
武三思，仰祭奉天乾陵大帝。東宮之位，合立廬陵王為儲君；若立武三思，終
當不得。」

　　第二諫

　　又一日，則天受朝。狄相奏曰：「太子何罪，遠貶房州千里，圖立姑之位
？臣上觀乾象，且無異主之文；中察人心，未厭唐家之德。」則天謂狄相曰：
「卿是一個人，爭知天下人心？」狄相奏曰：「昔陛下在長安之日，有北方單
于寇擾唐邑。緣何先帝存日，不與交戰？彼時兵寡，故不與敵。遂將兩庫金帛
，命梁王武三思招召，要軍千萬，與單于戰，前後十餘月，招召人數，不滿千
百。及廬陵王代之，不經旬日，計兵千萬。單于探得，不戰自退。以愚臣見解
，度量天下人心，未厭唐家之意。東宮之位，合立廬陵王為儲君，武三思終當
不得。」

　　第三諫

　　又一日，則天問狄相曰：「卿云：『上觀乾象，且無異主之文。』朕自為
君以來，有什麼聖明？有什麼無道？」狄相奏曰：「陛下為君以來，聖明似不
少，無道亦絕多。陛下在長安之日，有龍鳳來儀，麒麟來現。岱州進表，有八
百里地方麥麩金。長安元年十二月上旬，花發。駕幸東都，有鳳現。回紇進五
色龜，日南進二角犀，藕州進鱷獸，西方佛足現。光宅二年，洛河泛漲，漂出
一石函，函內有鐵札，篆書金字云：『武后登萬萬年。』」則天問曰：「上觀
乾象，且無異主之文，惟復是朕登萬萬年，惟復是武家子孫登萬萬年？」狄相
奏曰：「臣聞古人有言：『有聞必先，有兆必應。』天地現相，陰陽泄機，在
乎人自應之耳。愚臣不敏，試論年代應萬萬之數，陛下為判。陛下在長安之日
，改元嗣聖元年，又改垂拱元年，又改□□元年，又改永昌元年，又改天授元
年，又改如意元年，又改長壽元年，又改光宅元年，又改延載元年。東都有五
鳳現，又改五鳳元年，又改萬歲通天元年，又改神功元年，又改聖曆元年，又
改久視元年。西方佛足現，又改大足元年，又改萬歲登封元年，又改長安元年
。以愚臣見解，陛下即位以來，改元之中有兩個萬歲元年，暗合萬萬年之數足
矣。定東宮之位，非廬陵王不可；立武三思，的然不得。」

　　第四諫

　　則天問狄曰：「卿云朕自為君以來，聖明亦不少，前言亦備矣，無道亦絕
多，試與朕說之。」狄相奏曰：「太子何罪？遠貶房州千里，擬立武三思為儲
君。陛下是女主，爭斷得三從五逆？」則天問曰：「何名三從五逆？」狄相奏
曰：「三從者：在家從父，出嫁從夫，夫殃從子。五逆者：在家不從父，出嫁
不從夫，夫殃不從子，是三逆；陛下親兒，遠貶房州，是四逆；立姪為儲君，
是五逆。愚臣直奏，輕觸龍顏。東宮之位，非廬陵王不可；立武三思，終當不
得。」

　　第五諫

　　則天聞狄相所奏，即命武士撮出，放大臣散。遂憑玉案略睡。少時，乃得
一夢，見湘輪水上流，車向壁上行，忽然驚覺。次日受朝，問門下侍郎張易之
：「朕昨日略憑玉案，略睡少時，忽得一夢，見湘輪水上流，車向壁上行，此
夢如何？」張易之曰：「助陛下好夢。輪者，周流不息，乾道也，上應乎天，
為陛下治世之象；水者，陰道也，是陛下之命。上流者，大吉之兆，永保千秋
；又夢車向壁上行，緣陛下聖朝蓋代，四夷來降，八表來朝，天下貢獻至多。
道路隘窄，感這車向壁上行。」則天大悅，顏動龍顏，賜易之珠金重寶，諸臣
山呼萬歲。惟有狄相不拜。則天乃問狄相曰：「卿何不拜？朕所夢家私事，莫
不見否？」狄相奏曰：「臣只見陛下邦國事，不見陛下家私事。陛下所夢，湘
輪水上流，車向壁上行，張易之園夢云輪是陛下身，水是陛下命，乃曲媚取容
，苟圖金寶。臣圓此夢，於國不祥。夫水者，陰道也。水望低流，本性也。車
同軌，公道也。今水不望下而望上流，是陰氣上盛而逆其天也；車向壁上行，
是無道也。陛下親兒遠貶房州，擬立武三思為儲君，此實為無道也。東宮之位
，非廬陵王不可；立武三思，決然不得。」

　　第六諫

　　則天睡至三更，又得一夢。夢與大羅天女對手著棋，局中有子，旋被打將
，頻輸天女，忽然驚覺。來日受朝，問諸大臣：「其夢如何？」狄相奏曰：「
臣圓此夢，於國不祥。陛下夢與大羅天女對手著棋，局中有子，旋被打將，頻
輸天女，蓋謂局中有子，不得其位，旋被打將，失其所主。今太子廬陵王貶房
州千里，是謂局中有子，不得其位，遂感此夢。臣願東宮之位，速立廬陵王為
儲君；若立武三思，終當不得。」

　　第七諫

　　則天不豫，狄相入閣門問疾。則天曰：「我夢鸚鵡雙翅折，其夢如何？」
狄相奏曰：「武者，陛下之姓，相王、廬陵王乃陛下之雙翅也。今皆遠貶，遂
感此夢。」時武三思在傍，怒發赤色。則天令武士撮出朝門。乃問侍臣曰：「
狄相與卿等意何如？」張易之奏曰：「狄相家貧，若多賜金寶，便可策立武三
思為儲君。」則天遂賞色羅十車、珠金兩床、御衣百箱，排於殿前，令武士召
狄相入朝。則天曰：「為子逆父，為臣逆君，祗緣策立之事，卿每偏執，苦諫
於朕，朕甚恥之。卿若不改見前解，只這殿前，是卿死處；若改見前解，取此
賞物。」狄相奏曰：「不然。憶昔太宗大帝在日，經綸四海，勇滅大隋，收王
世充，戮竇建德，八十二處草賊，鞍不離馬背，甲不離將身，親冒矢石，以定
天下，皆為後世子孫，可不為李家枝葉？臣意宏道元命先帝臨崩之夜，以愛子
托陛下，以社稷囑付大臣，臣今受此賞物，卻立外姓，是臣賣卻唐家社稷。臣
往九泉之下，無面可見高宗大帝。臣惟守直而死，不可邪佞而生。東宮之位，
合立廬陵王為儲君；若立武三思，的然不當。」

　　第八諫

　　則天令武士於殿前置油鍋，宣狄相入朝。則天問狄相曰：「若改見前解，
則與卿長保富貴；若不改見前解，這殿前油鍋是卿死處。」狄相奏曰：「臣當
年邁，佐陛下邦國不得，策立之事，便合依從，不合違赦。據臣罪愆，合當萬
死。容臣徵古，死亦不遲。」則天曰：「徵古之事，如何？」狄相奏曰：「徵
古者，以太子天下根本，本以搖而天下皆動。陛下以一心之欲，輕天下之動哉
！且姑之與姪孰近？子之與母更親。寧學寒蟬潔饑，不學螳螂戲飽；乍立廬陵
王而死，不立武三思而生。陛下長如今日，則萬事絕言。若也萬歲之後，將武
三思為儲君，只將武家宗祖，於太廟享祭，自古宗廟，無祔姑之禮，陛下有何
干預？若立廬陵王為儲君，陛下萬歲之後，四時祭奠無虧。如此，姑之與姪孰
近？子之與母孰親？東宮之位，合廬陵王為儲君；立武三思，終當不得。」復
前奏曰：「臣既不得策立太子，即以死報先帝。復願陛下以老臣之言熟思之，
以萬世無疆之計。」言訖，褰衣大步欲跳入油鍋，則天連聲叫武士執其裾，曰
：「朕從今日起，依卿所奏。」

　　第九諫

　　則天因此感悟，遂遣中使往房州，密召廬陵王為嗣。廬陵王引咎韜晦，久
處房陵，勝得民情，舉留不放。遂佯為放鷹，隊仗出城。至於南山，矯衣而入
，坐於中宮，外人無有知者。又遣黃門，宣狄相入朝，賜坐於簾外。則天謂曰
：「我欲立武三思，群臣無有異議者。唯卿不從，幾欲致卿於死地。前日見卿
所奏，朕心豁然，方見利害。已依卿所奏，遣使已召廬陵，現到中宮，與卿相
見。」命左右褰簾，命廬陵王拜公。公見太子，謂二十餘年不見太子動靜，雖
殺身成仁，不審大位果能正否？及見太子，嗚咽流涕，殞絕於地。則天命左右
起之，以手拊公背曰：「豈朕之臣，乃社稷之臣也。」已而顧謂太子曰：「今
日國老與汝作天子。」狄相奏曰：「未可。陛下當年貶太子往房州，天下人知
。今太子歸朝，宰相尚有不知者，還宮無儀，知是誰立？」則天曰：「據國老
所見，如何得立？」狄相奏曰：「伏請太子往龍門，望降召發親王宗正，相率
百官，備禮以迎，便可策立。」則天曰：「依卿所奏。」廬陵王因狄相，策立
為唐家第四帝，後廟號中宗。

　　《梁公九諫》一卷，賜書樓藏舊鈔本，此載諸讀書敏求記中者也。今此本

無崖集，宋闕鈔補者。每葉板心皆刻賜書樓所鈔，字跡審是明人書，未知即此

姑蘇吳岫家藏」，此吳方山也。皆吾郡中人。二人皆明嘉靖時人，皆藏書家，
則此書之珍重由來已久。偶為他邑所得，而仍歸郡中。物之流傳，固自有異，
然更得也。是翁一番記述。不愈足引重乎！
　　　　嘉慶癸亥三月朔，黃丕烈書。
　　題書紀事詩，久絕響矣。即欲為三益聯吟之續，而良友弗聚，異書不來，
意興殊索然也。閒窗檢點舊藏，出此《梁公九諫》一卷，仍用舊例，獨吟新詩
，亦聊為破寂之助云爾：
　　九諫詞猶在，文章振李唐。

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
