水調歌頭（送章徳茂大卿使金）

不見南師乆，謾説北羣空。當塲隻手，畢竟還我萬夫雄。自笑堂堂漢使，得似
洋洋河水，依舊只流東。且復穹廬拜，會向藳街逢。 堯之都，舜之壤，禹之封
，於中應有，一個半個挽琱弓。萬裏烽煙如許，千古英靈安在，磅礴幾時通。
世運何湏問，赫日自當中。


又（癸夘九月十五日壽朱元晦）

人物從來少，籬菊為誰黃。去年今日，倚樓還是聽行藏。未覺霜風無賴，好在
月華如水，心事楚天長。講論叅洙泗，盃酒到虞唐。 人未醉，歌宛轉，興悠揚
，太平胸次，笑他磊磈欲成狂。且向武夷深處，坐對雲煙開歛，逸思入微茫。
我欲為君夀，何許得新腔。

又（和吳允成逰靈洞韻）

人愛新來景，龍認舊時湫。不論三伏，小住便覺凜生秋。我自醉眠其上，任是
水流其下，湍激若為収。世事如斯去，不去為誰留。 本無心，隨所寓。觸虗舟
，東山始末，且向靈洞與沈浮。料得神仙窟穴，爭似提封萬裏，大小幾琉球，
但有君才具，何用問時流。

又（和趙周錫）

事業隨人品，今古幾麾旌。向來謀國，萬事盡出汝書生。安識鵾鵬變化，九萬
裏風在下，如許上南溟。斥鷃旁邊笑，河漢一頭傾。 嘆世間，多少恨。幾時平
，覇圖消歇，大家創見又成驚。邂逅漢家龍種，正爾烏紗白紵，馳騖覺身輕。
樽酒從渠說，雙眼為誰明。


念奴嬌（至金陵）

江南春色，筭來是，多少勝遊清賞。妖冶廉纖，只做得，飛鳥向人偎傍。地闢
天開，精神朗慧，到底還京様，人家小語，一聲聲近清唱。 因念舊日山城，個
人如畫，已作中州想。鄧禹笑人無限也，冷落不堪惆悵。秋水雙明，高山一弄
，著我些悲壯，南徐好住，片帆有分來往。

又（登多景樓）

危樓還望，嘆此意，今古幾人曾會。龜設神施，渾認作，天限南疆圵界。一水
橫陳，連崗三面，做出爭雄勢。六朝何事，只成門戶私計。 因笑王謝諸人，登
髙懐逺，也學英雄涕。憑卻江山管不到，河洛祲氛無際。正好長驅，不須反顧
，尋取中流誓，小兒破賊，勢成寧問彊對。

又（送戴少望叅選）

西風帶暑，又還是，長途利牽名役。我已無心，君因甚，更把青衫為客。邂逅
卑飛，幾時高舉，不露真消息。大家行處，到頭須管行得。 何處尋取狂徒，可
能著意，更問渠儂骨。天上人間，最好是，閙裏一般岑寂。瀛海無波，玉堂有
路，穏著青霄翼。歸來何事，眼光依舊生碧。


賀新郎（同劉元實唐與正陪葉丞相飲）

脩竹更深處，映簾櫳，清陰障日，坐來無暑。水激泠泠知何許，跳碎危欄玉樹
。都不繫，人間朝莫。東閣少年今老矣，況樽中有酒嫌推去，猶著我名流語。
大家綠野陪容與，筭等閒，過了薫風，又還商素。手弄柔條人健否，猶憶當時
雅趣。恩未報，恐成辜負，舉目江河休感涕，念有君，如此應忘阻，歌未罷，
誰來舞？

又（寄辛幼安和見懷韻）

老去慿誰說，看幾番，神奇臭腐，夏裘冬葛。父老長安今餘幾，後死無讐可雪
。猶未燥，當時生髪。二十五弦多少恨，筭世間，那有平分月，羌婦弄漢宮瑟
。樹猶如此堪重別，只使君，從來與我，話頭多合，行矣置之無足問，誰換妍
皮癡骨。但莫使，伯牙絃絶。九轉丹砂牢拾取，管精金，只是鐵，龍共虎，聲
應裂。

又（酧辛幼安再用韻見寄）

離亂從頭說，愛吾民，金繒不愛，蔓藤纍葛。壯筆盡消人脆好，冠蓋陰山觀雪
。虧殺我，一星星髪，涕出女吳成倒轉，問魯為齊，弱何年月，丘也幸，由之
瑟。斬新換出旗麾別，把當時，一樁大義，拆開収合。據地一呼吾徃矣，萬裏
搖肢動骨。這話覇，只成癡絶，天地洪爐誰扇韝，算於中，安得長堅鐵，淝水
破，闗東裂。

又（懐辛幼安用前韻）

話殺渾閒說，不成教，齊民也解，為伊為葛，樽酒相逢成二老，卻憶去年風雪
，新著了，幾莖華髪。百世尋人猶接踵，嘆只今兩地三人月，冩舊恨，向誰瑟
。男兒何用傷離別，況古來，幾畨際會，風從雲合。千裏情親長晤對，妙體本
心次骨。臥百尺，髙樓鬥絶，天下適安耕且老，看買犁賣劎平家鐵，壯士淚，
肺肝裂。

滿江紅（懐韓子師尚書）

曾洗乾坤，問何事，雄圖頓屈。試著眼，階除當下，又添英物。圵向爭衡幽憤
在，南來遺恨狂酋失。算淒涼部曲幾人存，三之一。 諸老盡，郎君出，恩未報
，家何恤。念橫飛直上，有時還戢。笑我只知存飽煗，感君原不論階級。休更
上百尺舊家樓，塵侵帙。

桂枝香（觀木樨有感寄呂郎中）

天高氣肅，正月色分明，秋容新沐，桂子初収，三十六宮都足。不辭散落人間
去，怕羣花，自嫌凡俗。向他秋晚，喚囘春意，幾曾幽獨。 是天公，餘香賸馥
，怪一樹香風，十裏相續。坐對花旁，但見色浮金粟。芙蓉只解添愁思，況東
籬，淒涼黃菊，入時太淺，背時太逺，愛尋髙躅。

三部樂（七月送丘宗卿使金）

小屈穹廬，但二滿三平，共勞均佚。人中龍虎，本為明時而出。只合是，端坐
王朝。看指揮整辦，埽蕩飄忽。也持漢節，聊過舊家宮室。 西風又還帶暑，把
征衫著上，有時披拂，休將看花淚眼，聞絃病骨。對遺民，有如皎日，行萬裏
，依然故物，入奏幾策，天下裏，終定於一。

又（七月卄六日壽王道甫）

入腳西風，漸去去來來，早三之一。春花無數，畢竟何如秋實。不須待，名品
如麻，試為君屈指，是誰層出。十朝半月，爭看摶空霜鶻。 從來別真共假，任
盤根錯節，更饒倉卒。還他濟時好手，封侯奇骨。沒些兒，媻姍勃窣，也不是
，崢嶸突兀。百二十歲，管做徹，元分人物。


瑞雪濃慢（六月十一日壽羅春伯）

蔗漿酪粉，玉壺氷醑，朝罷更聞宣賜。去天咫尺，下拜再三，幸今有母可遺。
年年此日，共道月入懷中最貴。向暑天，正風雲會遇，有恁嘉瑞。 鶴沖霄，魚
得水，一超便，直入神仙地。植根江表，開拓兩河，做得黒頭公未。騎鯨赤手
，問何如，長鞭尺箠。向來王謝風流，只今管是。

阮郎歸（重午壽外舅）

波光渺渺浸晴陂，有亭湖岸西。芰荷香拂栁絲垂，升堂獻壽巵。 紅約腕，緑侵
衣。願祝屇期頤。花間妙語欲無詩，一年歌一詞。

祝英臺近（六月十一日送葉正則如江陵）

駕扁舟，衝劇暑。千裏江上去，夜宿晨興。一一舊時路。百年忘了旬頭，被人
攙破，故紙裏，是爭雄處。 怎生訴，欲待細與分疏，其如有憑據。包裹生魚，
活底怎遭遇。相逢樽酒何時，征衫容易，君去也，自家須住。

又（九月一日壽兪德載）

嫩寒天，金氣雨，攬斷一秋事。仝様霏微，還作小晴意。世間萬寶都成，些兒
無欠，只待與，黃花為地。 好招致，對此鬱鬱蔥蔥，新篘未成醉。番手為雲，
造物等兒戱，也知冨貴來時，一班呈露，便做出人中祥瑞。

蝶戀花（甲辰夀元晦）

手撚黃花還自笑，笑比淵明，莫也歸來早。隨世功名渾草草，五湖卻共繁華老
。 冷淡家生寃得道，旖旎妖嬈，春夢如今覺。管領歲華須到了，此花之後花應
少。

蔔算子（九月十八日夀徐子才）

悄靜菊花天，洗盡梧桐雨。倍九週遭爛漫開，祝壽當頭取。 頂戴禦袍黃，疉秀
金稜吐。仙種花容晚節香，人願爭先覩。

垂絲釣（九月七日自壽）

菊花細雨，蕭蕭紅蓼汀渚。景物漸幽，風致如許。秋未莫，又值吾初度。 看天
宇，正澄淸欲往。登髙未也，紅塵當面飛舞。幾人弔古，烏帽牢收取。短髪還
羞覷，遐壽身，近五雲深處。

彩鳯飛（一作彩鳯舞七月十六日壽錢伯同）

人立玉，天如水，特地如何撰。海南沈燒著，欲寒猶煗。算從頭，有多少，厚
徳陰功，人家上，一一舊時香案，煞經慣。 小駐吾州纔爾，依然歡聲滿。莫也
教，公子王孫眼見。這些兒，頴脫處，髙出書巻，經綸自入手，不了判斷。

鷓鴣天（懐王道甫）

落魄行歌記昔逰，頭顱如許尚何求。心肝吐盡無餘事，口腹安然豈逺謀。 纔怕
暑，又傷秋，天涯夢斷有書不。大都眼孔新來淺，羨爾微官作計周。

謁金門（送徐子宜如新安）

新雨足，洗盡山城袢溽。見說好峯三十六，峯峯如立玉。 四海英逰追逐，事業
相時伸縮。入境徳星須做福，只愁金詔趣。

天仙子（七月十五日壽內）

一夜秋光先著栁，暑力平明羞失守。西風不放入簾幃，饒永晝，沈煙透。半月
十朝秋定否。 指點芙蕖凝佇久，髙處成蓮深處藕。百年長共月團圎，女進酒，
男稱夀。一點浮雲人似舊。

洞仙歌（丁未夀朱元晦）

秋容一洗，不受凡塵涴。許大乾坤這囘大，向上頭，些子是鵰鶚摶空。籬底下
，只有黃花幾朶。 騎鯨汗漫，那得人同坐。赤手丹心撲不破，問唐虞，禹湯武
多少功名，猶自是，一點浮雲鏟過，且燒卻，一瓣海南沈，任拈取，千年陸沈
竒貨。

踏莎行（懐葉八十推官）

書冊如仇，舊逰渾諱，有懐不斷人應異。千山上去夢魂輕，片帆似下蠻溪水。
 已共酒盃，長堅海■，見君忽忘花前醉。從來解事苦無多，不知解到毫芒未。

南鄉子（謝永嘉諸友相餞）

人物滿東甌，別我江心識俊逰。北盡平蕪南似畫，中流，誰繫龍驤萬斛舟。 去
去幾時休，猶是潮來更上頭。醉墨淋漓人感舊，離愁，一夜西風似夏不。

點絳唇（詠梅月）

一夜相思，水邊清淺橫枝瘦。小窻如晝，情共香俱透。 清入夢魂，千裏人長乆
。君知否，雨僝雲僽，格調還依舊。

龍川詞

●龍川詞跋

同甫，一名同，永康人。光宗策進士，羣臣奏其巻第三，禦筆擢第一。既知為
同甫，大喜。又有天留遺朕之詔，其恩遇如此。據葉水心序，其集雲四十巻，
今行本止三十巻。想尚多佚遺，其最著者，莫如上皇帝四書及酌古論，自贊雲
：人中之龍，文中之虎。真無忝矣。第本集載詞選三十闋。無甚詮次。如寄辛
幼安、賀新郎三首，錯見前後。予家蔵《龍川詞》一巻，又每調類分，未知孰
是。讀至巻終，不作一妖語媚語，殆所稱不受人憐者歟。湖南毛晉識。

●龍川詞補遺

水龍吟（春恨）

閙花深處層樓，畫簾半捲東風軟。春歸翠陌，平莎茸嫩，垂楊金淺。遲日催花
，淡雲閣雨，輕寒輕煗。恨芳菲世界，遊人未嘗，都付與，鸎和燕。 寂莫憑髙
念逺，向南樓，一聲歸雁。金釵鬭草，青絲勒馬，風流雲散，羅綬分香，翠綃
封淚，幾多幽怨。正銷魂，又是疎煙淡月，子規聲斷。

洞仙歌（雨）

瑣窗秋莫，夢髙唐人困，獨立西風萬千恨。又檐花落處，滴碎空堦，芙容院，
無限秋容老盡。 枯荷摧欲折，多少離聲，鎖斷天涯訴幽悶。似蓬山去後，方士
來時，揮粉淚，點點梨花香潤。斷送得，人間夜霖鈴，更葉落梧桐，孤燈成暈
。

虞美人（春愁）

東風蕩颺輕雲縷，時送蕭蕭雨。水邊臺榭燕新歸，一口香泥濕帶，落花飛。 海
棠糝徑鋪香繡，依舊成春痩。黃昏庭院栁啼鴉，記得那人和月，折梨花。

眼兒媚（春愁）

試燈天氣又春來，難說是情懐。寂寥聊似，揚州何遜，不為江梅。 扶頭酒醒爐
香灺，心緒未全灰。愁人最是，黃昏前後，煙雨樓臺。

思佳客（春感）

花拂闌幹栁拂空，花枝綽約栁鬟鬆。蝶翻淡碧低邊影，鶯囀濃香杪處風。 深院
落，小簾櫳，尋芳猶憶舊相逢。橋邊攜手歸來路，踏皺殘花幾片紅。

清平樂（秋晚，伯成兄徃龍興山中，意其登山臨水，不無閨房之思。作此詞惱
之。）

銀屏繡閣，不道鮫綃薄。嘶騎囪囪塵漠漠，還過夕陽村落。 亂山千疊無情，今
宵遮斷愁人。兩處香消夢覺，一般曉月秋聲。

滴滴金

斷橋雪霽聞啼鳥，對林花，弄晴曉。畫角吹香客愁醒，見梢頭紅小。 團酥剪蠟
知多少，向風前，壓春倒。江嶂人煙畫圖中，有短篷香繞。 龍川詞補遺


●龍川詞補遺跋

余正喜同甫，不作妖語媚語。偶閲中興詞選，得水龍吟，以後七闋亦未能超然
。但無一調合本集者。或雲：贋作。葢花菴與同甫俱南渡後人，何至誤謬若此
。或花菴專選綺艷一種，而同甫子沈所編本集，特表阿翁磊落骨幹，故若出二
手。況本集雲：詞選則知同甫之詞，不止於三十闋，即補此花菴所選，亦安得
雲全豹耶。姑梓之以俟。博雅君子湖南毛晉又識。

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
