漱玉詞（一卷）

宋·李清照

☆

孤雁兒（並序·世人作梅詞，下筆便俗。予試作一篇，乃知前言不妄耳）

藤床紙帳朝眠起。說不盡、無佳思。沈香斷續玉爐寒，伴我情懷如水。
笛裡三弄，梅心驚破，多少春情意。
小風疏雨蕭蕭地。又催下、千行淚。吹簫人去玉樓空，腸斷與誰同倚。
一枝折得，人間天上，沒個人堪寄。

☆

滿庭霜

小閣藏春，閑窗鎖晝，畫堂無限深幽。篆香燒盡，日影下簾鉤。
手種江梅更好，又何必、臨水登樓。無人到，寂寥渾似，何遜在揚州。
從來，知韻勝，難堪雨藉，不耐風柔。更誰家橫笛，吹動濃愁。
莫恨香消雪減，須信道、掃跡情留。難言處，良宵淡月，疏影尚風流。

☆

玉樓春

紅酥肯放瓊苞碎。探著南枝開遍未。不知醞藉幾多香，但見包藏無限意。
道人憔悴春窗底。悶損闌干愁不倚。要來小酌便來休，未必明朝風不起。

☆

漁家傲

雪裡已知春信至。寒梅點綴瓊枝膩。香臉半開嬌旖旎。當庭際。玉人浴出新妝洗。
造化可能偏有意。故教明月玲瓏地。共賞金尊沈綠蟻。莫辭醉。此花不與群花比。

☆

清平樂

年年雪裡。常插梅花醉。挼盡梅花無好意。贏得滿衣清淚。
今年海角天涯。蕭蕭兩鬢生華。看取晚來風勢，故應難看梅花。

☆

南歌子

天上星河轉，人間簾幕垂。涼生枕簟淚痕滋。起解羅衣聊問、夜何其。
翠貼蓮蓬小，金銷藕葉稀。舊時天氣舊時衣。只有情懷不似、舊家時。

☆

轉調滿庭芳

芳草池塘，綠陰庭院，晚晴寒透窗紗。玉鉤金鎖，管是客來目沙。
寂寞尊前席上，惟愁、海角天涯。能留否，酴醿落盡，猶賴有梨花。
當年，曾勝賞，生香薰袖，活火分茶。極目猶龍驕馬，流水輕車。
不怕風狂雨驟，恰才稱、煮酒殘花。如今也，不成懷抱，得似舊時那時。

☆

漁家傲

天接雲濤連曉霧。星河欲轉千帆舞。仿佛夢魂歸帝所。聞天語。殷勤問我歸何處。
我報路長嗟日暮。學詩謾有驚人句。九萬裡風鵬正舉。風休住。蓬舟吹取三山去。

☆

如夢令

常記溪亭日暮。沈醉不知歸路。興盡晚回舟，誤入藕花深處。爭渡。爭渡。
驚起一灘鷗鷺。

☆

如夢令

昨夜雨疏風驟。濃睡不消殘酒。試問卷簾人，卻道海棠依舊。知否。知否。
應是綠肥紅瘦。

☆

多麗（詠白菊）

小樓寒，夜長簾幕低垂。恨蕭蕭、無情風雨，夜來揉損瓊肌。
也不似、貴妃醉臉，也不似、孫壽愁眉。
韓令偷香，徐娘傅粉，莫將比擬未新奇細看取、屈平陶令，風韻正相宜。
微風起，清芬醞藉，不減酴醿。
漸秋闌、雪清玉瘦，向人無限依依。似愁凝、漢皋解佩，似淚灑、紈扇題詩。
朗月清風，濃煙暗雨，天教憔悴度芳姿。縱愛惜、不知從此，留得幾多時。
人情好，何須更憶，澤畔東籬。

☆

菩薩蠻

風柔日薄春猶早。夾衫乍著心情好。睡起覺微寒。梅花鬢上殘。
故鄉何處是。忘了除非醉。沈水臥時燒。香消酒未消。

☆

菩薩蠻

歸鴻聲斷殘雲碧。背窗雪落爐煙直。燭底鳳釵明。釵頭人勝輕。
角聲催曉漏。曙色回牛鬥。春意看花難。西風留舊寒。

☆

浣溪沙

莫許杯深琥珀濃。未成沈醉意先融。疏鐘已應晚來風。
瑞腦香消魂夢斷，辟寒金小髻鬟松。醒時空對燭花紅。

☆

浣溪沙

小院閑窗春色深。重簾未卷影沈沈。倚樓無語理瑤琴。
遠岫出山催薄暮，細風吹雨弄輕陰。梨花欲謝恐難禁。

☆

浣溪沙

淡蕩春光寒食天。玉爐沈水裊殘煙。夢回山枕隱花鈿。
海燕未來人鬥草，江海已過柳生綿。黃昏疏雨濕秋千。

☆

鳳凰台上憶吹簫

香冷金猊，被翻紅浪，起來人未梳頭。任寶奩閑掩，日上簾鉤。
生怕閑愁暗恨，多少事、欲說還休。今年瘦，非干病酒，不是悲秋。
明朝，這回去也，千萬遍陽關，也即難留。
念武陵春晚，雲鎖重樓，記取樓前綠水，應念我、終日凝眸。
凝眸處，從今更數，幾段新愁。

☆

一剪梅

紅藕香殘玉簟秋。輕解羅裳，獨上蘭舟。雲中誰寄錦書來，雁字回時，月滿西樓。
花自飄零水自流。一種相思，兩處閑愁。此情無計可消除，才下眉頭，卻上心頭。

☆

蝶戀花

淚濕羅衣脂粉滿。四疊陽關，唱到千千遍。人道山長山又斷。蕭蕭微雨聞孤館。
惜別傷離方寸亂。忘了臨行，酒盞深和淺。好把音書憑過雁。東萊不似蓬萊遠。

☆

蝶戀花

暖日晴風初破凍。柳眼梅腮，已覺春心動。酒意詩情誰與共。淚融殘粉花鈿重。
乍試夾衫金縷縫。山枕斜欹，枕損釵頭鳳。獨抱濃愁無好夢。夜闌猶剪燈花弄。

☆

鷓鴣天

寒日蕭蕭上鎖窗。梧桐應恨夜來霜。酒闌更喜團茶苦，夢斷偏宜瑞腦香。
秋已盡，日猶長。仲宣懷遠更凄涼。不如隨分尊前醉，莫負東籬菊蕊黃。

☆

小重山

春到長門春草青。江梅些子破，未開勻。碧雲籠碾玉成塵。留曉夢，驚破一甌春。
花影壓重門。疏簾鋪淡月，好黃昏。二年三度負東君。歸來也，著意過今春。

☆

怨王孫

湖上風來波浩渺。秋已暮、紅稀香少。水光山色與人親，說不盡、無窮好。
蓮子已成荷葉老。青露洗、萍花汀草。眠沙鷗鷺不回頭，似也恨、人歸早。

☆

臨江仙

語作“庭院深深”數闋，其聲即舊臨江仙也。
庭院深深深幾許，雲窗霧閣常扃。柳梢梅萼漸分明。春歸秣陵樹，人客遠安城。
感月吟風多少事，如今老去無成。誰憐憔悴更凋零。試燈無意思，踏雪沒心情。

☆

醉花陰

薄霧濃雲愁永晝。瑞腦消金獸。佳節又重陽，玉枕紗廚，半夜涼初透。
東籬把酒黃昏後。有暗香盈袖。莫道不消魂，簾卷西風，人似黃花瘦。

☆

好事近

風定落花深，簾外擁紅堆雪。長記海棠開後，正是傷春時節。
酒闌歌罷玉尊空，青缸暗明滅。魂夢不堪幽怨，更一聲啼鴃。

☆

訴衷情

夜來沈醉卸妝遲。梅萼插殘枝。酒醒熏破春睡，夢遠不成歸。
人悄悄，月依依。翠簾垂。更挼殘蕊，更捻余香，更得些時。

☆

行香子

草際鳴蛩。驚落梧桐。正人間、天上愁濃。雲階月地，關鎖千重。
縱浮槎來，浮槎去，不相逢。
星橋鵲駕，經年才見，想離情、別恨難窮。牽牛織女，莫是離中。
甚霎兒晴，霎兒雨，霎兒風。

☆

添字醜奴兒

窗前誰種芭蕉樹，陰滿中庭。陰滿中庭。葉葉心心，舒卷有余情。
傷心枕上三更雨，點滴霖霪。點滴霖霪。愁損北人，不慣起來聽。

☆

憶秦娥

臨高閣。亂山平野煙光薄。煙光薄。棲鴉歸後，暮天聞角。
斷香殘酒情懷惡。西風催襯梧桐落。梧桐落。又還秋色，又還寂寞。

☆

念奴嬌（春情）

蕭條庭院，又斜風細雨，重門須閉。寵柳嬌花寒食近，種種惱人天氣。
險韻詩成，扶頭酒醒，別是閑滋味。征鴻過盡，萬千心事難寄。
樓上幾日春寒，簾垂四面，玉闌干慵倚。被冷香消新夢覺，不許愁人不起。
清露晨流，新桐初引，多少游春意。日高煙斂，更看今日晴未。

☆

永遇樂

落日镕金，暮雲合璧，人在何處。染柳煙濃。吹梅笛怨，春意知幾許。
元宵佳節，融和天氣，次第豈無風雨。來相召、香車寶馬，謝他酒朋詩侶。
中州盛日，閨門多暇，記得偏重三五。鋪翠冠兒，捻金雪柳，簇帶爭濟楚。
如今憔悴，風鬟霜鬢，怕見夜間出去。不如向、簾兒底下，聽人笑語。

☆

武陵春（春晚）

風住塵香花已盡，日晚倦梳頭。物是人非事事休。欲語淚先流。
聞說雙溪春尚好，也擬泛輕舟。只恐雙溪舴艋舟。載不動、許多愁。

☆

怨王孫（春暮）

帝裡春晚。重門深院。草綠階前，暮天雁斷。樓上遠信誰傳。恨綿綿。
多情自是多沾惹。難拚舍又是寒食也。秋千巷陌，人靜皎月初斜。浸梨花。

☆

長壽樂（南昌生日）

微寒應候。望日邊六葉，階蓂初秀。愛景欲掛扶桑，漏殘銀箭，杓回搖鬥。
慶高閎此際，掌上一顆明珠剖。有令容淑質，歸逢佳偶。到如今，晝錦滿堂貴胄。
榮耀，文步紫禁，一一金章綠綬。更值棠棣連陰，虎符熊軾，夾河分守。
況青雲咫尺，朝暮重入承明後。看彩衣爭獻，蘭羞玉酎。祝千齡，借指松椿比壽。

☆

蝶戀花（上巳召親族）

永夜懨懨歡意少。空夢長安，認取長安道。為報今年春色好。花光月影宜相照。
隨意杯盤雖草草。酒美梅酸，恰稱人懷抱。醉莫插花花莫笑。可憐春似人將老。

☆

聲聲慢

尋尋覓覓，冷冷清清，凄凄慘慘戚戚。乍暖還寒時候，最難將息。
三杯兩盞淡酒，怎敵他、晚來風急。雁過也，正傷心，卻是舊時相識。
滿地黃花堆積。憔悴損，如今有誰堪摘。守著窗兒，獨自怎生得黑。
梧桐更兼細雨，到黃昏、點點滴滴。這次第，怎一個、愁字了得。

☆

點絳唇（閨思）

寂寞深閨，柔腸一寸愁千縷。惜春春去。幾點催花雨。
倚遍闌干，只是無情緒。人何處。連天衰草，望斷歸來路。

☆

減字木蘭花

賣花擔上。買得一枝春欲放。淚染輕勻。猶帶彤霞曉露痕。
怕郎猜道。奴面不如花面好。雲鬢斜簪。徒要教郎比並看。

☆

攤破浣溪沙

揉破黃金萬點輕。剪成碧玉葉層層。風度精神如彥輔，大鮮明。
梅蕊重重何俗甚，丁香千結苦粗生。熏透愁人千裡夢，卻無情。

☆

攤破浣溪沙

病起蕭蕭兩鬢華。臥看殘月上窗紗。豆蔻連梢煎熟水，莫分茶。
枕上詩書閑處好，門前風景雨來佳。終日向人多藉藉，木犀花。

☆

瑞鷓鴣（雙銀杏）

風韻雍容未甚都。尊前甘橘可為奴。誰憐流落江湖上，玉骨冰肌未肯枯。
誰教並蒂連枝摘，醉後明皇倚太真。居士擘開真有意，要吟風味兩家新。

☆

臨江仙（梅）

庭院深深深幾許，雲窗霧閣春遲。為誰憔悴損芳姿。夜來清夢好，應是發南枝。
玉瘦檀輕無限恨，南樓羌管休吹。濃香吹盡有誰知。暖風遲日也，別到杏花肥。

☆

慶清朝

禁幄低張，彤闌巧護，就中獨占殘春。容華淡佇，綽約俱見天真。
待得群花過後，一番風露曉妝新。妖嬈艷態，妒風笑月，長殢東君。
東城邊，南陌上，正日烘池館，竟走香輪。綺筵散日，誰人可繼芳塵。
更好明光宮殿，幾枝先近日邊勻。金尊倒，拚了盡燭，不管黃昏。

☆

浣溪沙

髻子傷春慵更梳。晚風庭院落梅初。淡雲來往月疏疏。
玉鴨熏爐閑瑞腦，朱櫻鬥帳掩流蘇。通犀還解辟寒無。

☆

浣溪沙（閨情）

繡幕芙蓉一笑開。斜飛寶鴨襯香腮。眼波才動被人猜。
一面風情深有韻，半箋嬌恨寄幽懷。月移花影約重來。

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
