張紫微原芝

高宗覽婁陟明（寅亮）之議，垂意祖烈，詔擇秦支，並建二王邸，恩禮未有隆殺也。
會連歲芝生太宮，百執事多進頌詩，張紫微（孝祥）時在館，獨獻文曰《原芝》。
紹興二十四年，芝生於太廟楹，當仁宗、英宗之室，詔群臣觀瞻，奉表文德殿賀。
既二年，芝復生其處，校書郎（臣）張孝祥作《原芝》曰：“非天私我有宋，
我祖宗在天，篤丕祐於子孫，明告之符，於惟欽哉！
在昔仁祖登三咸五，以天下為公，授我英宗，以永我基祚，於惟欽哉！
我聖天子躬濟大業，既平既治，上怡下嬉。
惟大本未立，社稷宗廟之靈，亦靡克寧饗，有燁茲芝，胡為乎來？
天維顯思，命不易哉，和氣致祥，敢曰不然。
曷不於他？乃廟產旃；曷不於他？於二宗之室；
曷不於他？再歲再出，於惟欽哉！夫意則然，我祖宗之意則然，於惟欽哉！
小（臣）敢告我聖天子，告我聖天子承天之意，承祖宗之意，早定大計，惟一無貳。
紛以貳起，辛伯有言，惟貳惟一，治忽所原，匪弗圖之，憂惟貳之懼。
敢告聖天子為萬世利，蠢爾小臣，越職罪死。弗罪以思，
惟我聖天子〔此處疑有脫誤〕，
言有一得，以裨吾國，萬死奚恤，渠敢愛死而畏越厥職。”
上得之喜，即擢為南宮郎。於是內廷始漸有所別，迄於建儲雲。

藝祖禁讖書
唐李淳風作《推背圖》。五季之亂，王侯崛起，人有倅心，故其學益熾。
閉口張弓之讖，吳越至以遍名其子，而不知兆昭武基命之烈也。
宋興受命之符，尤為著明。藝祖即位，始詔禁讖書，懼其惑民志以繁刑闢。
然圖傳已數百年，民間多有藏本，不復可收拾，有司患之。
一日，趙韓王以開封具獄奏，因言犯者至眾，不可勝誅。
上曰：“不必多禁，正當混之耳。”
乃命取舊本，自己驗之外，皆紊其次第而雜書之，凡為百本，使與存者並行。
於是傳者懵其先後，莫知其孰訛；間有存者，不復驗，亦棄弗藏矣。
《國朝會要》太平興國元年十一月，諸州解到習天文人，以能者補靈台，
謬者悉黥流海島，蓋亦障其流，不得不然也。

徐鉉入聘
國初三徐，名著江左，皆以博洽聞中朝，而騎省鉉，又其白眉者也。
會修述職之貢，騎省實來，及境，例差官押伴。朝臣皆以辭令不及為憚，
宰相亦艱其選，請於藝祖。
玉音曰：“姑退朝，朕自擇之。”有頃，左璫傳宣殿前司，
具殿侍中不識字者十人，以名入。
宸筆點其中一人，曰：“此人可。”
在廷皆驚，中書不敢請，趣使行，殿侍者慌不知所繇，薄弗獲己，竟往渡江。
始燕，騎省詞鋒如雲，旁觀駭愕。
其人不能答，徒唯唯；騎省叵測，強聒而與之言。
居數日，既無與之酬復者，亦倦且默矣。
餘按當時陶、竇諸名儒，端委在朝，若使角辯騁詞，庸詎不若鉉？
藝祖正以大國之體，不當如此耳，其亦不戰屈人，兵之上策歟！
其後，王師徵包茅於煜，騎省復將命請緩師，其言累數千言，
上諭之曰：“不須多言，江南亦何罪？但天下一家，卧榻之側，豈容他人鼾睡耶！”
大哉聖言，其視騎省之辯，正猶螢爝之擬羲舒也。
騎省名甚著，三徐者，近世或概為昆弟。
餘嘉定辛未在故府，樓宣獻（鑰）嘗出手編《辨鸞岡三墓》，餘謝不前考。
後讀周文忠必大《游山錄》，有衛尉卿延休、騎省鉉、內史鍇，蓋父子甚明。
而餘已去國，不復得請益雲。
　
石城堡寨
六朝建國江左，台城為天闕，復築石頭城於右，宿師以守，蓋如古人連營之制。
然古今議攻守者，多疑以為分兵力而無用。
東陽陳同父（亮）嘗上書乞移都建康，謂古台城當在今鐘山，
而大司馬門在馬軍新營之側，今城乃江南李氏所築耳。
使六朝因今城以守，則不費侯景輩數日力，何以歷年如彼其久乎。
因言曹武惠登長乾，兀術上雨花臺，城中秋毫不能遁。
餘嘗親歷其地，其說皆是，第指古台城所在，要未有明據，亦出臆度。
自清涼寺而上，皆古石頭頹墉，猶可識其址，皆依山而高，然則六朝非不知備也。
楊文節（萬里）持漕節，嘗有詩曰：“已守台城更石城，不知並力或分營。
六師只合環天闕，一壘真成借寇兵。
向者王、蘇俱解此，冤哉隗協可憐生。若言虎踞渾堪倚，萬歲千秋無戰爭。”
其旨明矣。淳熙乙未，郭棣帥淮東，築維揚城，
又旁築一城曰堡寨，地皆砥平，相去餘數里。
雖牽制之勢亦不相及，竟不曉何謂，猶不若石城之得失相半也。
　
湯岐公罷相
湯岐公（思退）相高宗，紹興三十一年，以煩言罷。
洪文安（遵）在翰林當直，例作平語，諫官隨而擊之，以祠去。
孝宗朝再相，隆興二年復罷。文安之兄文惠（適）適視草焉，又作平語，
侍御史晁（公武）亦擊之，文惠請外，
上曰：“公武言卿黨思退，朕謂平詞出朕意。”固卻其章，仍徙戶侍矣。
蓋其相兩朝，再罷相，乃累洪氏二兄弟，先後若出一轍，可笑如此。
岐公中間科時，與文敏（邁）實同年雲。
　
南陔脫帽
神宗朝，王襄敏（韶）在京師，會元夕張燈，金吾弛夜，家人皆步出將帷觀焉。
幼子（寀）第十三，方能言，珠帽襐服，馮肩以從。
至宣德門，上方御樓，薌雲彩鰲，簫吹雷動，
士女仰視，喧擁闐咽，轉盻已失所在，騶馭皆恇擾不知所為。
家人不復至帷次，狼狽歸，未敢白請捕。襄敏訝其反之亟，問知其為南陔也，
曰：“他子當遂訪，若吾十三，必能自歸。”怡然不復求。咸叵測。
居旬日，內出犢車至第，有中大人下宣旨，抱南陔以出諸車，
家人驚喜，迎拜天語。既定，問南陔以所之。
乃知是夕也，姦人利其服裝，自襄敏第中已竊跡其後。既負而趨，
南陔覺負已者之異也，亟納珠帽於懷。
適內家車數乘將入東華，南陔過之，攀幰呼焉。中大人悅其韶秀，抱置之膝。
翌早，擁至上閣，以為宜男之祥。上問以誰氏，竦然對曰：“兒乃韶之幼子也。”
具道所以，上顧以占對不凡，且嘆其早惠，曰：“是有子矣。”
令暫留，欽聖鞠視；密詔開封捕賊以聞，既獲，盡戮之。
乃命載以歸，且以具獄示襄敏，賜壓驚金犀錢果，直鉅萬。
其機警見於幼年者，已如此。
南陔，寀自號，政和間有文聲，敢為不詘，亢其幼者也。
餘在南徐，與其孫（遇）游，傳其事。
　
張元吳昊
景祐末，有二狂生曰張曰吳，皆華州人。
薄游塞上，覘覽山川風俗，慨然有志於經略。
恥於自售，放意詩酒，語皆絕豪嶮驚人，而邊帥豢安，皆莫之知。
倀無所適，聞夏酋有意窺中國，遂叛而往。二人自念不力出奇，無以動其聽。
乃自更其名，即其都門之酒家，劇飲終日，引筆書壁曰：“張元、吳昊，來飲此樓。
”邏者見之，知非其國人也，跡其所憩，執之。夏酋詰以入國問諱之義。
二人大言曰：“姓尚不理會，乃理會名耶！”時曩霄未更名，且用中國賜姓也。
於是竦然異之，日尊寵用事。寶元西事，蓋始此。
其事國史不書，詩文雜見於《田承君集》、沈存中《筆談》、洪文敏《容齋三筆》，
其為人概可想見。
文敏謂二人名，偶與酋同，實不詳其所以更之意雲。
　
王義豐詩
王（阮）者，德安人，仕至撫州守，嘗從張紫微學詩。
紫微罷荊州，侍總得翁以歸，偕之游廬山。
暇日，出詩捲相與商榷，自謂有得。山南有萬杉寺，本仁皇所建，奎章在焉。
紫微大書二章，其一曰：“老乾參天一萬株，廬山佳處著浮圖。
秪因買斷山中景，破費神龍百斛珠。
”其二曰：“莊田本是昭陵賜，更著官船載御書。
今日山僧無飯吃，卻催官欠意何如？”
阮得此詩，獨憮然不滿意，曰：“先生氣吞虹蜺，今獨少卑之，何也？”
紫微不復言，送之江津。別去才兩旬，而得湖陰之訃矣。紫微蓋於此絕筆。
阮是時亦自有二十八字，曰：“昭陵龍去奎文在，萬歲靈杉守百神。
四十二年真雨露，山川草木至今春。”紫微大擊節，自以為不及。
既而復過是寺，又題其碑陰曰：“碧紗籠底墨才乾，白玉樓中骨已寒。
淚盡當時聯騎客，黃花時節獨來看。”亦紆徐有味雲。
阮所作詩，號《義豐集》，刻江泮，其出於藍者蓋鮮，校官馮（椅）為之序。
　
琵琶亭術者
淳熙己酉，哲文倦勤，詔以北宮為重華宮。
光宗既登極，群臣奉表請以誕聖日為重明節，如故事。
時先君召還省闥，過鄉邦，維舟琵琶亭。
新暑初袢，小憩亭上，有術者以拆字自名，過矣。
因漫呼問家人字跡，多奇中，命飲之酒，
忽作而曰：“近得邸報乎！重華、重明非佳名也。
其文皆二千日，兆在是矣。”先君掩耳起立，亟以數鐶謝遣之。
既而甲寅之事，果如其言，此與太平興國一人六十之讖無異。
豈天道證應，固有數乎！抑符合之偶然也。
　
汴京故城
開寶戊辰，藝祖初修汴京，大其城址，曲而宛，如蚓詘焉。
耆老相傳，謂趙中令鳩工奏圖，初取方直，
四面皆有門，坊市經緯其間，井井繩列。
上覽而怒，自取筆塗之，命以幅紙作大圈，紆曲縱斜，旁註雲：“依此修築。”
 故城即當時遺跡也。時人咸罔測，多病其不宜於觀美。
熙寧乙卯，神宗在位，遂欲改作，
鑒苑中牧豚及內作坊之事，卒不敢更，第增陴而已。
及政和間，蔡京擅國，亟奏廣其規，以便宮室苑囿之奉，命宦侍董其役。
凡周旋數十里，一撒而方之如矩，墉堞樓櫓，雖甚藻飾，而蕩然無曩時之堅樸矣。
一時迄功第賞，侈其事，至以表記，兩命詞科之題，概可想見其張皇也。
靖康胡馬南牧，黏罕、斡離不揚鞭城下，有得色，曰：“是易攻下。”
令植炮四隅，隨方而擊之。城既引直，一炮所望，一壁皆不可立，竟以此失守。
沉幾遠睹，至是始驗。宸筆所定圖，承平時藏秘閣，今不復存。
　
施宜生
施宜生，福人也。少游鄉校，有僧過焉，與之言，引之鱣堂下，風檐杲日，
援手周視曰：“餘善風鑒，子有奇相，故欲驗予術耳。歸，它日當語子。”
又數年，過諸塗，宜生方躓場屋，不勝困，欲投筆，漫徵前說，以所向扣之。
僧出酒一壺，與之藉草飲，復援其手曰：“面有權骨，可公可卿，而視子身之毛，
皆逆上，且覆腕，然則必有以合乎此，而後可貴也。”
時範汝為訌建劍，宜生心欲以嚴莊、尚讓自期，
而未脫諸口，聞其言大喜，杖策徑謁，乾以秘策，汝為恨得之晚，亟尊用之。
亡何而汝為敗，變服為傭，渡江至泰。有大姓吳翁者，家僮數千指，擅魚鹽之饒。
宜生傭其間，三年，人莫之覺也。翁獨心識之。
一日，屏人問曰：“天下方亂，英雄鏟跡，亦理之常。
我視汝非傭，必以實告，不然，且捕汝於官。”
宜生不服，曰：“我服傭事惟恭，主人乃爾置疑，請辭而已。”
翁固詰之，則請其故。翁曰：“汝動作皆傭，而微有未盡同者。
餘日者燕客，執事咸俊，而汝獨孫諸儕，撤器有噫聲，若欿然不怡，此魚服而角也。
我固將全汝，而何以文為？”
宜生驚汗，亟拜曰：“主實生我，不敢匿。”遂告之繇。
翁曰：“官購方急，圖形遍城野，汝安所逃？
龜山有僧，可托以心，餘交之舊矣。介以入北，策之良也。”
從之，翁贐之金，隱之衲，至寺，服緇童之服以求納。
主僧者出，儼然鄉校之所見也，啟緘而留之。餘數旬，持橈夜濟宜生於淮，
曰：“大丈夫富貴命耳！予無求報心，天實命汝，知復如何，
必得志，毋忘中國，逆而順，天所祐也。”
虜法無驗不可行，遂殺一人於道，而奪其符，以至於燕。
上書自言道國虛實，不見用，縻而致之黃龍。會赦得釋，因以教授自業。
虜有附試畔歸之士，謂之歸義，試連捷。
逆亮時有意南牧，校獵國中，一日而獲熊三十六，廷試多士，遂以命題，蓋用唐體。
宜生奏賦曰：“聖天子，講武功，雲屯八百萬騎，日射三十六熊。”
亮覽而喜，擢為第一。不數年，仕至禮部尚書。
紹興三十年，虜來賀正旦，宜生以翰林侍講學士為之使。
朝廷聞之，命張忠定（燾）以吏部尚書侍讀，館之都亭。
時戎盟方堅，國備大弛，而諜者傳造舟調兵之事無虛日，上意不深信。
館者因以首丘風之，至天竺，微問其的。
宜生顧其介不在旁，忽瘦語曰：“今日北風甚勁。”
又取幾間筆扣之，曰：“筆來！筆來！”於是始大警。
及高景山告釁，而我粗有備矣，宜生實先漏師焉。歸為介所告，烹而死。
宜生方顯時，龜山僧至其國，言於亮而尊顯之，俾乘驛至京，東視海舟，
號“天使國師”，不知所終。
僧蹤跡有異，淮人能言之。出入兩境如跳河，輕財結客，又有至術，髡而俠者也。
逆而顯，順而戮，豈其相然耶！椎埋於先，一折枝而贖其惡，固神理之所不容也。
國史逸其事，餘聞之淮士臧子西如此。
　
晉盆杅
餘居負山，在湓城之中。先君未卜築時，嘗為戎帥皇甫斌宅，斌歸於袁，虛其室。
山有堅土，凡市之塗塈版築，鹹得而畚致之。
無孰何者，遂罄其半，獨餘一面壁立。餘家既來，始厲其禁，而山已不支。
慶元元年五月，大雨隤其巔，古冢出焉。
初僅數甓流下，其上有刻如瑞草，旁著字曰：“晉永寧元年五月造。”
又有匠者姓名曰張某，下有文如押字。隸或得之以獻，莫知所從來。
居數日而山隤，塈周半墮，骨發棺槨，皆無存矣。
兩旁列瓦碗二十餘，左壁有一燈，尚熒熒，取之即滅。
猶有油如膏，見風凝結不可抉。碗中有甘蔗節，它皆已化。
有小瓷瓶，如硯滴，竅其背為蝦蟆形，制其樸。足下有一瓦盆，如褻器。
有銅帶數銙，髹合，餘者一片傅木，如鐵。有半鏡。
一銅盆絕類今洗羅，殊無古制度，中有雙魚，盆底有四鐶附著，不測其所以用。
一銅杅，穴底，與市井庖人汁器同制。每甓著年月姓名，如先獲者，環塈皆是。
碣曰：“晉徵虜將軍墓”，餘既哀而掩之，既數日復雨，山無址，竟捏焉。
餘考《晉書》，永寧蓋惠帝年號，距今九百餘載。
是時蓋未有城郭，徵虜之名，漢雖有之，
在晉以此官顯者，不著於史，又無名氏可見。
甓範必有字，古人作事，如此不苟。
押字之制，世以為起於唐韋陟五朵雲，而不知晉已有之。
餘固疑其似而非，又不可強識，亦可異也。
凡物皆腐，而燈燭尚明，驪山人魚之說，固容有之。
蕭統《文選·弔冥漠君文》，亦有蔗，意其殽核之所重雲。
陶器以再隤皆碎裂，餘或為親識間持去。
盆杅僅在，而餘侍親如閩，留於家。丙辰歲，詔禁挾銅者。
州家大索以輸嚴之神泉監，家人懼，杅復偕送官，獨盆偶櫝它所，今乃巋然存。
其出其毀，要必有時，亦重可嘆也。因志於此，以俟博識。

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
