〈序〉

《傳》曰：「飽食終日，無所用心，不有博弈者乎。」桓譚《新論》曰：「世
有圍棋之戲，或言是兵法之類。上者，遠其疏，張罝以會，圍困而成，得道
妊荂C中者，則務相絕遮，要以爭便利，故勝負狐疑，須計數以定。下者，則
守邊隅、趨作罫，以自生於小地。」春秋而下，代有其人。則弈棋之道，從來
|矣。今取勝敗之要，分為十三篇，有與兵法合者，亦附于中云爾。張靖序。


〈論局篇〉第一

夫萬物之數，從一而起。局之路，三百六十有一。一者，生數之主，據其極
而運四方也。三百六十，以象周天之數。分而為四，以象四時。隅各九十路，
以象其日。外周七二路，以象其候。枯棋三百六十，白黑相半，以法陰陽。局
局u道，謂之枰。線道之間，謂之罫。局方而靜，棋圓而動。自古及今，弈者無
同局。《傳》曰：「日日新。」故宜用意深而存慮精，以求其勝負之由，則至
其所未至矣。


〈得算篇〉第二

棋者，以正合其勢，以權製其敵。故計定於內，而勢成於外。戰未合而算勝者
，得算多也。算不勝者，得算少也。戰已合而不知勝負者，無算也。兵法曰：
「多算勝，少算不勝，而況於無算乎？由此觀之，勝負見矣。」


〈權輿篇〉第三

權輿者，弈棋布置，務守綱格。先於四隅分定勢子，然後拆二斜飛，下勢子一
央C立二可以拆三，立三可以拆四，與勢子相望可以拆五。近不必比，遠不必乖
。此皆古人之論，後學之規，舍此改作，未之或知。《詩》曰：「靡不有初
，鮮克有終。」


〈合戰篇〉第四

博弈之道，貴乎謹嚴。高者在腹，下者在邊，中者佔角，此棋家之常然。法曰
：寧輸數子，勿失一先。有先而後，有後而先。擊左則視右，攻後則瞻前。兩
生勿斷，皆活勿連。闊不可太疏，密不可太促。與其戀子以求生，不若棄子而
取勢；與其無事而強行，不若因之而自補。彼眾我寡，先謀其生；我眾彼寡，
務張其勢。善勝者不爭，善陣者不戰，善戰者不敗，善敗者不亂。夫棋始以正
合，終以奇勝。必也，四顧其地，牢不可破，方可出人不意，掩人不備。凡
敵無事而自補者，有侵襲之意也；棄小而不就者，有圖大之心也；隨手而下者
，無謀之人也；不思而應者，取敗之道也。《詩》云：「惴惴小心，如臨於谷
。」


〈虛實篇〉第五

夫弈棋，緒多則勢分，勢分則難救。投棋勿逼，逼則使彼實而我虛。虛則易攻
，實則難破。臨時變通，宜勿執一。《傳》曰：「見可而進，知難而退。」


〈自知篇〉第六

夫智者見於未萌，愚者暗於成事。故知己之害而圖彼之利者，勝。知可以戰不
可以戰者，勝。識眾寡之用者，勝。以虞待不虞者，勝。以逸待勞者，勝。不
戰而屈人者，勝。《老子》曰：「自知者明。」



〈審局篇〉第七

夫弈棋布勢，務相接連。自始至終，著著求先。臨局離爭，雌雄未決，毫厘不
可以差焉。局勢已羸，專精求生。局勢已弱，銳意侵綽。沿邊而走，雖得其
生者，敗。弱而不伏者，愈屈；躁而求勝者，多敗。兩勢相違，先蹙其外；
勢孤援寡，則勿走。機危陣潰，則勿下。是故，棋有不走之走，不下之下。誤
人者多方，成功者一路而已。能審局者多勝。《易》曰：「窮則變，變則通
，通則久。」



〈度情篇〉第八

人生而靜，其情難見；感物而動，然後可辨。推之於棋，勝敗可得而先驗。持
咻虓G者多得，輕易而貪者多喪；不爭而自保者多勝，務殺而不顧者多敗。因敗
而思者，其勢進；戰勝而驕者，其勢退。求己弊不求人之弊者，益；攻其敵而
不知敵之攻己者，損。目凝一局者，其思周；心役他事者，其慮散。行遠而
羲怞N，機淺而詐者凶。能畏敵者強，謂人莫己若者亡。意旁通者高，心執一者
卑。語默有常，使敵難量。動靜無度，招人所惡。《詩》云：「他人之心，
予時度之。」


〈斜正篇〉第九

或曰：「棋以變詐為務，劫殺為名，豈非詭道耶？」予曰：「不然。」《易》
云：「師出以律，否藏，凶。」兵本不尚詐，謀言詭行者，乃戰國縱橫之說。
棋雖小道，實與兵合。故棋之品甚繁，而弈之者不一。得品之下者，舉無思慮
，動則變詐。或用手以影其勢，或發言以泄其機。得品之上者，則異於是。皆
沉思而遠慮，因形而用權。神游局內，意在子先。圖勝於無朕，滅行於未然。
豈假言辭喋喋，手勢翩翩者哉？《傳》曰：「正而不譎。」其是之謂歟？


〈洞微篇〉第十

凡棋有益之而損者，有損之而益者。有侵而利者，有侵而害者。有宜左投者，
有宜右投者。有先著者，有後著者。有緊避者，有慢行者。粘子勿前，棄子思
後。有始近而終遠者，有始少而終多者。欲強外先攻內，欲實東先擊西。路虛
而無眼，則先覷。無害於他棋，則做劫。饒路則宜疏，受路則勿戰。擇地而侵
，無礙而進。此皆棋家之幽微也，不可不知也。《易》曰：「非天下之至精，
其孰能與於此！」


〈名數篇〉第十一

夫弈棋者，凡下一子，皆有定名。棋之形勢、死生、存亡，因名而可見。有沖
，有斡，有綽，有約，有飛，有關，有劄，有粘，有頂，有尖，有覷，有門，
有打，有斷，有行，有捺，有立，有點，有聚，有蹺，有夾，有拶，有避，有
刺，有勒，有撲，有徵，有劫，有持，有殺，有松，有槃。圍棋之名，三十有
二，圍棋之人，意在可周。臨局變化，遠近縱橫，吾不得而知也。用倖取勝
，難逃此名。《傳》曰：「必也，正名乎棋！」


〈品格篇〉第十二

夫圍棋之品有九。一曰入神，二曰坐照，三曰具體，四曰通幽，五曰用智，六
曰小巧，七曰鬥力，八曰若愚，九曰守拙。九品之外不可勝計，未能入格，今
不複云。《傳》曰：「生而知之者，上也；學而知之者，次也；困而學之，又
其次也。」


〈雜說篇〉第十三

夫棋邊不如角，角不如腹。約輕於捺，捺輕於避。夾有虛實，打有情偽。逢綽
多約，遇拶多粘。大眼可贏小眼，斜行不如正行。兩關對直則先覷，前途有礙
則勿徵。施行未成，不可先動。角盤曲四，局終乃亡。直四扳六，皆是活棋
；花聚透點，多無生路。十字不可先紐；勢子在心，勿打角圖。弈不欲數，數
則怠，怠則不精；弈不欲疏，疏則忘，忘則多失。勝不言，敗不語。振廉讓之
楫怴A君子也；起忿怒之色者，小人也。高者無亢，卑者無怯。氣和而韻舒者
，喜其將勝也。心動而色變者，憂其將敗也。赧莫赧於易，恥莫恥於盜。妙莫
妙於用松，昏莫昏於複劫。

凡棋直行三則改，方聚四則非。勝而路多，名曰贏局；敗而無路，名曰輸籌。
皆籌為溢，停路為[艸巾]。打籌不得過三，淘子不限其數。劫有金井、轆轤，
有無休之勢，有交遞之圖。弈棋者不可不知也。凡棋有敵手，有半先，有先兩
，有桃花五，有北斗七。夫棋者有無之相生，遠近之相成，強弱之相形，利害
妞蛚氶A不可不察也。是以安而不泰，存而不驕。安而泰則危，存而驕則亡。
《易》曰：「君子安而不忘危，存而不忘亡。」


〈跋〉

自宋以弈顯名天下者，昔年待詔老劉宗。今日劉仲甫、楊中隱，以至王琬、
]侁、郭範、李百祥輩。人人皆能誦此十三篇，體其常而生其變也。古人謂猶盤
中走圓，橫斜曲直，繫於臨時，不可盡知，而必可知者，是圓不能出於盤也。
棋經，盤也；弈者，圓也。士君子無所用心，則可觀焉。

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
