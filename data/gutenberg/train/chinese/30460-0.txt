出師表 / 諸葛亮

前出師表

臣亮言：先帝創業未半而中道崩殂。今天下三分，益州疲弊，此誠危急存亡之秋
也。然侍衞之臣，不懈於內；忠志之士，忘身於外者；蓋追先帝之殊遇，欲報之
於陛下也。誠宜開張聖聽，以光先帝遺德，恢宏志士之氣；不宜妄自菲薄，引喻
失義，以塞忠諫之路也。

宮中、府中，俱為一體，陟罰臧否，不宜異同。若有作姦犯科，及為忠善者，宜
付有司，論其刑賞，以昭陛下平明之治；不宜偏私，使內外異法也。

侍中、侍郎郭攸之、費褘、董允等，此皆良實，志慮忠純，是以先帝簡拔以遺陛
下。愚以為宮中之事，事無大小，悉以咨之，然後施行，必能裨補闕漏，有所廣
益。將軍向寵，性行淑均，曉暢軍事，試用於昔日，先帝稱之曰能，是以衆議舉
寵為督。愚以為營中之事，悉以咨之，必能使行陣和睦，優劣得所也。

親賢臣，遠小人，此先漢所以興隆也；親小人，遠賢臣，此後漢所以傾頹也。先
帝在時，每與臣論此事，未嘗不歎息痛恨於桓、靈也。侍中尚書、長史、參軍，
此悉貞良死節之臣也，願陛下親之、信之，則漢室之隆，可計日而待也。

臣本布衣，躬耕於南陽，苟全性命於亂世，不求聞達於諸侯。先帝不以臣卑鄙，
猥自枉屈，三顧臣於草廬之中，諮臣以當世之事。由是感激，遂許先帝以驅馳。
後值傾覆，受任於敗軍之際，奉命於危難之間，爾來二十有一年矣。先帝知臣謹
慎，故臨崩寄臣以大事也。受命以來，夙夜憂探，恐託付不效，以傷先帝之明，
故五月渡瀘，深入不毛。今南方已定，兵甲已足，當獎率三軍，北定中原。庶竭
駑鈍，攘除姦凶，興復漢室，還於舊都。此臣所以報先帝，而忠陛下之職分也。

至於斟酌損益，進盡忠言，則攸之、褘、允之任也。願陛下託臣以討賊興復之效
；不效，則治臣之罪，以告先帝之靈。若無興德之言，則責攸之、褘、允之慢，
以彰其咎。陛下亦宜自課，以咨諏善道，察納雅言，深追先帝遺詔，臣不勝受恩
感激。今當遠離，臨表涕泣，不知所云。

後出師表

先帝慮漢、賊不兩立，王業不偏安，故托臣以討賊也。以先帝之明，量臣之才，
故知臣伐賊，才弱敵強也。然不伐賊，王業亦亡。惟坐而待亡，孰與伐之？是故
托臣而弗疑也。臣受命之日，寢不安席，食不甘味；思惟北征，宜先入南：故五
月渡瀘，深入不毛，並日而食。臣非不自惜也：願王業不可偏安於蜀都，故冒危
難以奉先帝之遺意。而議者謂為非計。今賊適疲於西，又務於東，兵法「乘勞」
：此進趨之時也。謹陳其事如左：

高帝明並日月，謀臣淵深，然涉險被創，危然後安；今陛下未及高帝，謀臣不如
良、平，而欲以長策取勝，坐定天下：此臣之未解一也。劉繇、王朗，各據州郡
，論安言計，動引聖人，群疑滿腹，眾難塞胸；今歲不戰，明年不征，使孫策坐
大，遂並江東：此臣之未解二也。曹操智計，殊絶於人，其用兵也，仿怫孫、吳
，然困於南陽，險於烏巢，危於祁連，逼於黎陽，幾敗北山，殆死潼關，然後偽
定一時耳；況臣才弱，而欲以不危而定之：此臣之未解三也。曹操五攻昌霸不下
，四越巢湖不成，任用李服而李服圖之，委任夏侯而夏侯敗亡，先帝每稱操為能
，猶有此失；況臣弩下，何能必勝：此臣之未解四也。自臣到漢中，中間期年耳
，然喪趙雲、陽群、馬玉、閻芝、丁立、白壽、劉合、鄧銅等，及驅長屯將七十
餘人，突將無前，叢叟、青羌，散騎武騎一千餘人，此皆數十年之內，所糾合四
方之精銳，非一州之所有；若復數年，則損三分之二也。--當何以圖敵：此臣之
未解五也。今民窮兵疲，而事不可息；事不可息，則與住行，勞費正等；而不及
今圖之，欲以一州之地，與賊持久：此臣之未解六也。

夫難平者，事也。昔先帝敗軍於楚，當此時，曹操拊手，謂天下已定。然後先帝
東連吳、越，西取巴、蜀，舉兵北征，夏侯授首：此操之失計，而漢事將成也。
然後吳更違盟，關羽毀敗，秭歸蹉跌，曹丕稱帝：凡事如是，難可逆見。臣鞠躬
盡瘁，死而後已；至於成敗利鈍，非臣之明所能逆睹也。

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
