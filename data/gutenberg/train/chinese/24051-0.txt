汧國夫人李娃﹐長安之倡女也。節行瑰奇﹐有足稱者。故監察御史向行簡為傳述。天寶
中﹐有常州刺史滎陽公者﹐略其名氏﹐不書﹐時望甚崇﹐家徒甚慇。知命之年﹐有一子
﹐始弱冠矣﹐雋朗有詞藻﹐迥然不群﹐深為時輩推伏。其父愛而器之﹐曰﹕“此吾家千
里駒也。”應鄉賦秀才舉﹐將行﹐乃盛其服玩車馬之飾﹐計其京師薪儲之費。謂之曰﹕
“吾觀爾之才﹐當一戰而霸。今備二載之用﹐且豐爾之給﹐將為其志也。”生亦自負視
上第如指掌。自毗陵發﹐月余抵長安﹐居于布政裡。嘗游東市還﹐自平康東門入﹐將訪
友于西南。至鳴珂曲﹐見一宅﹐門庭不甚廣﹐而室宇嚴邃﹐闔一扉。有娃方憑一雙鬟青
衣立﹐妖姿要妙﹐絕代未有。生忽見之﹐不覺停驂久之﹐徘徊不能去。乃詐墜鞭于地﹐
候其從者﹐敕取之﹐累眄于娃﹐娃回眸凝睇﹐情甚相慕﹐竟不敢措辭而去。生自爾意若
有失﹐乃密征其友游長安之熟者以訊之。友曰﹕“此狹邪女李氏宅也。”曰﹕“娃可求
乎﹖”對曰﹕“李氏頗贍﹐前與通之者﹐多貴戚豪族﹐所得甚廣﹐非累百萬﹐不能動其
志也。”生曰﹕“苟患其不諧﹐雖百萬﹐何惜﹗”他日﹐乃潔其衣服﹐盛賓從而往。扣
其門﹐俄有侍兒啟扃。生曰﹕“此誰之第耶﹖”侍兒不答﹐馳走大呼曰﹕“前時遺策郎
也。”娃大悅曰﹕“爾姑止之﹐吾當整妝易服而出。”生聞之﹐私喜。乃引至蕭牆間﹐
見一姥垂白上僂﹐即娃母也。生跪拜前致詞曰﹕“聞茲地有隙院﹐願稅以居﹐信乎﹖”
姥曰﹕“懼其淺陋湫隘﹐不足以辱長者所處﹐安敢言直耶﹖”延生于遲賓之館﹐館宇甚
麗。與生偶坐﹐因曰﹕“某有女嬌小﹐技藝薄劣﹐欣見賓客﹐願將見之。”乃命娃出﹐
明眸皓腕﹐舉步艷冶。生遂驚起﹐莫敢仰視。與之拜畢﹐敘寒燠﹐觸類妍媚﹐目所未睹
。復坐﹐烹茶斟酒﹐器用甚潔。久之日暮﹐鼓聲四動。姥訪其居遠近。生之曰﹕“在
延平門外數裡。”冀其遠而見留也。姥曰﹕“鼓已發矣﹐當速歸﹐無犯禁。”生曰﹕“
幸接歡笑﹐不知日之雲夕。道裡遼闊﹐城內又無親戚﹐將若之何﹖”娃曰﹕“不見責僻
陋﹐方將居之﹐宿何害焉。”生數目姥﹐姥曰﹕“唯唯。”生乃召其家僮﹐持雙縑﹐請
以備一宵之饌。娃笑而止之曰﹕“賓主之儀﹐且不然也。今夕之費﹐願以貧窶之家﹐隨
其粗以進之。其餘以俟他辰。”固辭﹐終不許。俄徙坐西堂﹐帷幕帘榻﹐煥然奪目﹔妝
奩衾枕。亦皆侈麗。乃張燭進饌﹐品味甚盛。徹饌﹐姥起。生娃談話方切﹐詼諧調笑﹐
無所不至。生曰﹕“前偶過卿門﹐遇卿適在屏間。厥後心常勤念﹐雖寢與食﹐未嘗或舍
。”娃答曰﹕“我心亦如之。”生曰﹕“今之來﹐非直求居而已﹐願償平生之志。但未
知命也若何。”言未終﹐姥至﹐詢其故﹐具以告。姥笑曰﹕“男女之際﹐大欲存焉。情
苟相得﹐雖父母之命﹐不能制也。女子固陋﹐曷足以荐君子之枕蓆﹗”生遂下階﹐拜而
謝之曰﹕“願以己為養。”姥遂目之為郎﹐飲酣而散。及旦﹐盡徙其囊橐﹐因家于李之
第。自是生屏跡戢身﹐不復與親知相聞﹐日會倡優儕類﹐狎戲游宴。囊中盡空﹐乃鬻駿
乘及其家僮。歲余﹐資財仆馬蕩然。邇來姥意漸怠﹐娃情彌篤。他日﹐娃謂生曰﹕“與
郎相知一年﹐尚無孕嗣。常聞竹林神者﹐報應如響﹐將致荐酹求之﹐可乎﹖”生不知其
計﹐大喜。乃質衣于肆﹐以備牢醴﹐與娃同謁祠宇而禱祝焉﹐信宿而返。策驢而後﹐至
裡北門﹐娃謂生曰﹕“此東轉小曲中﹐某之姨宅也﹐將憩而覲之﹐可乎﹖”生如其言﹐
前行不逾百步﹐果見一車門。窺其際﹐甚弘敞。其青衣自車後止之曰﹕“至矣。”生下
﹐適有一人出訪曰﹕“誰﹖”曰﹕“李娃也。”乃入告。俄有一嫗至﹐年可四十餘﹐與
生相迎曰﹕“吾甥來否﹖”娃下車﹐嫗逆訪之曰﹕“何久髮絕﹖”相視而笑。娃引生拜
之﹐既見﹐遂偕入西戟門偏院。中有山亭﹐竹樹蔥茜﹐池榭幽絕。生謂娃曰﹕“此姨之
私第耶﹖”笑而不答﹐以他語對。俄獻茶果﹐甚珍奇。食頃﹐有一人控大宛﹐汗流馳至
曰﹕“姥遇暴疾頗甚﹐殆不識人﹐宜速歸。”娃謂姨曰﹕“方寸亂矣﹐某騎而前去﹐當
令返乘﹐便與郎偕來。”生擬隨之﹐其姨與侍兒偶語﹐以手揮之﹐令生止于戶外﹐曰﹕
“姥且歿矣﹐當與某議喪事﹐以濟其急﹐奈何遽相隨而去﹖”乃止﹐共計其凶儀齋祭之
用。日晚﹐乘不至。姨言曰﹕“無復命何也﹖郎驟往覘之﹐某當繼至。”生遂往﹐至舊
宅﹐門扁鑰甚密﹐以泥緘之。生大駭﹐詰其鄰人。鄰人曰﹕“李本稅此而居﹐約已周矣
。第主自收﹐姥徙居而且再宿矣。”征徙何處﹐曰﹕“不詳其所。”生將馳赴宣陽﹐以
詰其姨﹐日已晚矣﹐計程不能達。乃弛其裝服﹐質饌而食﹐賃榻而寢﹐生恚怒方甚﹐自
昏達旦﹐目不交睫。質明﹐乃策蹇而去。既至﹐連扣其扉﹐食頃無人應。生大呼數四﹐
有宦者徐出。生遽訪之﹕“姨氏在乎﹖”曰﹕“無之。”生曰﹕“昨暮在此﹐何故匿之
﹖”訪其誰氏之第﹐曰﹕“此崔高書宅。昨者有一人稅此院﹐雲遲中表之遠至者﹐未暮
去矣。”生惶惑發狂﹐罔知所措﹐因返訪布政舊邸。邸主哀而進膳。生怨懣﹐絕食三日
﹐遘疾甚篤﹐旬余愈甚。邸主懼其不起﹐徙之于凶肆之中。綿綴移時﹐合肆之人﹐共傷
嘆而互飼之。後稍愈﹐杖而能起。由是凶肆日假之﹐令執繐帷﹐獲其直以自給。累月﹐
漸復壯﹐每聽其哀歌﹐自嘆不及逝者﹐輒嗚咽流涕﹐不能自止。歸則效之。生聰敏者也
﹐無何﹐曲盡其妙﹐雖長安無有倫比。初﹐二肆之佣凶器者﹐互爭勝負。其東肆車輿皆
奇麗﹐殆不敵。唯哀挽劣焉。其東肆長知生妙絕﹐乃醵錢二萬索顧焉。其黨耆舊﹐共較
其所能者﹐陰教生新聲﹐而相贊和。累旬﹐人莫知之。其二肆長相謂曰﹕“我欲各閱所
佣之器于天門街﹐以較優劣。不勝者﹐罰直五萬﹐以備酒饌之用﹐可乎﹖”二肆許諾﹐
乃邀立符契﹐署以保證﹐然後閱之。士女大和會﹐聚至數萬。於是裡胥告于賊曹﹐賊曹
聞于京尹。四方之士﹐盡赴趨焉﹐巷無居人。自旦閱之﹐及亭午﹐歷舉輦輿威儀之具﹐
西肆皆不勝﹐師有慚色。乃置層榻于南隅﹐有長髯者﹐擁鐸而進﹐翊衛數人﹐於是奮髯
揚眉﹐扼腕頓顙而登﹐乃歌《白馬》之詞。恃其夙勝﹐顧眄左右﹐旁若無人。齊聲讚揚
之﹐自以為獨步一時﹐不可得而屈也。有頃﹐東肆長于北隅上設連榻﹐有烏巾少年﹐左
右五六人﹐秉翣而至﹐即生也。整衣服﹐俯仰甚徐﹐申喉發調﹐容若不勝。乃歌《薤露
》之章﹐舉聲清越﹐響振林木。曲度未終﹐聞者歔欷掩泣。西肆長為眾所誚﹐益慚恥﹐
密置所輸之直于前﹐乃潛遁焉。四座愕眙﹐莫之測也。先是天子方下詔﹐俾外方之牧﹐
歲一至闕下﹐謂之入計。時也﹐適遇生之父在京師﹐與同列者易服章﹐竊往觀焉。有老
豎﹐即生乳母婿也﹐見生之舉措辭氣﹐將認之而未敢﹐乃泫然流涕。生父驚而詰之﹐因
告曰﹕“歌者之貌﹐酷似郎之亡子。”父曰﹕“吾子以多財為盜所害﹐奚至是耶﹖”言
訖﹐亦泣。及歸﹐豎間馳往﹐訪于同黨曰﹕“向歌者誰﹐若斯之妙歟﹖”皆曰﹕“某氏
之子。”征其名﹐且易之矣﹐豎凜然大驚。徐往﹐迫而察之。生見豎﹐色動回翔﹐將匿
于眾中。豎遂持其袂曰﹕“豈非某乎﹖”相持而泣﹐遂載以歸。至其室﹐父責曰﹕“志
行若此﹐污辱吾門﹐何施面目﹐復相見也﹖”乃徒行出﹐至曲江西杏園東﹐去其衣服。
以馬鞭鞭之數百。生不勝其苦而斃﹐父棄之而去。其師命相狎昵者﹐陰隨之﹐歸告同黨
﹐共加傷嘆。令二人葦席瘞焉。至則心下微溫﹐舉之良久﹐氣稍通。因共荷而歸﹐以葦
筒灌勺飲﹐經宿乃活。月余﹐手足不能自舉﹐其楚撻之處皆潰爛﹐穢甚。同輩患之﹐一
夕棄于道周。行路咸傷之﹐往往投其餘食﹐得以充腸。十旬﹐方杖策而起。被布裘﹐裘
有百結﹐襤褸如懸鶉。持一破甌巡于閭裡﹐以乞食為事。自秋徂冬﹐夜入于糞壤窟室﹐
晝則週游廛肆。一旦大雪﹐生為凍餒所驅。冒雪而出﹐乞食之聲甚苦﹐聞見者莫不淒惻
。時雪方甚﹐人家外戶多不發。至安邑東門﹐循裡垣﹐北轉第七八﹐有一門獨啟左扉﹐
即娃之第也。生不知之﹐遂連聲疾呼﹕“飢凍之甚。”音響淒切﹐所不忍聽。娃自閣中
聞之﹐謂侍兒曰﹕“此必生也﹐我辨其音矣。”連步而出。見生枯瘠疥癘﹐殆非人狀。
娃意感焉﹐乃謂曰﹕“豈非某郎也﹖”生憤懣絕倒﹐口不能言﹐頷頤而已。娃前抱其頸
﹐以繡襦擁而歸于西廂。失聲長慟曰﹕“令子一朝及此﹐我之罪也。”絕而復甦。姥大
駭奔至﹐曰﹕“何也﹖”娃曰﹕“某郎。”姥遽曰﹕“當逐之﹐奈何令至此。”娃斂容
卻睇曰﹕“不然﹐此良家子也﹐當昔驅高車﹐持金裝﹐至某之室﹐不踰期而蕩盡。且互
設詭計﹐舍而逐之﹐殆非人行。令其失志﹐不得齒于人倫。父子之道﹐天性也。使其情
絕﹐殺而棄之﹐又困躓若此。天下之人﹐盡知為某也。生親戚滿朝﹐一旦當權者熟察其
本末﹐禍將及矣。況欺天負人﹐鬼神不祐﹐無自貽其殃也。某為姥子﹐迨今有二十歲矣
。計其貲﹐不啻直千金。今姥年六十餘﹐願計二十年衣食之用以贖身﹐當與此子別卜所
詣。所詣非遙﹐晨昏得以溫清﹐某願足矣。”姥度其志不可奪﹐因許之。給姥之余﹐有
百金。北隅四五家﹐稅一隙院。乃與生沐浴﹐易其衣服﹐為湯粥通其腸﹐次以酥乳潤其
臟。旬余﹐方荐水陸之饌。頭巾履襪﹐皆取珍異者衣之。未數月﹐肌膚稍腴。卒歲﹐平
愈如初。異時﹐娃謂生曰﹕“體已康矣﹐志已壯矣。淵思寂慮﹐默想曩昔之藝業﹐可溫
習乎﹖”生思之曰﹕“十得二三耳。”娃命車出游﹐生騎而從。至旗亭南偏門鬻墳典之
肆﹐令生揀而市之﹐計費百金﹐盡載以歸。因令生斥棄百慮以志學﹐俾夜作晝﹐孜孜矻
矻。娃常偶坐﹐宵分乃寐。伺其疲倦﹐即諭之綴詩賦。二歲而業大就﹐海內文籍﹐莫不
該覽。生謂娃曰﹕“可策名試藝矣。”娃曰﹕“未也﹐且令精熟﹐以俟百戰。”更一年
﹐曰﹕“可行矣。”於是遂一上登甲科﹐聲振禮闈。雖前輩見其文﹐罔不斂衽敬羨﹐願
友之而不可得。娃曰﹕“未也。今秀士苟獲擢一科第﹐則自謂可以取中朝之顯職﹐擅天
下之美名。子行穢跡鄙﹐不侔于他士。當礱淬利器﹐以求再捷﹐方可以連衡多士﹐爭霸
群英。“生由是益自勤苦﹐聲價彌甚。其年遇大比﹐詔征四方之雋。生應直言極諫策科
﹐名第一﹐授成都府參軍。三事以降﹐皆其友也。將之官﹐娃謂生曰﹕“今之復子本軀
﹐某不相負也。願以殘年﹐歸養老姥。君當結媛鼎族﹐以奉蒸嘗。中外婚媾﹐無自黷也
。勉思自愛﹐某從此去矣。”生泣曰﹕“子若棄我﹐當自剄以就死。”娃固辭不從﹐生
勤請彌懇。娃曰﹕“送子涉江﹐至於劍門﹐當令我回。”生許諾。月余﹐至劍門。未及
發而除書至﹐生父由常州詔入﹐拜成都尹﹐兼劍南採訪使。浹辰﹐父到。生因投刺﹐謁
于郵亭。父不敢認﹐見其祖父官諱﹐方大驚﹐命登階﹐撫背慟哭移時。曰﹕“吾與爾父
子如初。”因詰其由﹐具陳其本末。大奇之﹐詰娃安在。曰﹕“送某至此﹐當令復還。
”父曰﹕“不可。”翌日﹐命駕與生先之成都﹐留娃于劍門﹐筑別館以處之。明日﹐命
媒氏通二姓之好﹐備六禮以迎之﹐遂如秦晉之偶。娃既備禮﹐歲時伏臘﹐婦道甚修﹐治
家嚴整﹐極為親所眷尚。後數歲﹐生父母偕歿﹐持孝甚至。有靈芝產于倚廬﹐一穗三秀
﹐本道上聞。又有白燕數十﹐巢其層甍。天子異之﹐寵錫加等。終制﹐累遷清顯之任。
十年間﹐至數郡。娃封汧國夫人﹐有四子﹐皆為大官﹐其卑者猶為太原尹。弟兄姻媾皆
甲門﹐內外隆盛﹐莫之與京。嗟乎﹐倡蕩之姬﹐節行如是﹐雖古先烈女﹐不能逾也。焉
得不為之嘆息哉﹗予伯祖嘗牧晉州﹐轉戶部﹐為水陸運使﹐三任皆與生為代﹐故諳詳其
事。貞元中﹐予與隴西公佐﹐話婦人操烈之品格﹐因遂述汧國之事。公佐拊掌竦聽﹐命
予為傳。乃握管濡翰﹐疏而存之。時乙亥歲秋八月﹐太原白行簡雲。

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
